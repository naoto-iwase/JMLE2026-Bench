Actually painless = painless, mild swelling, not diffuse? It may have a tender? It can have a diffuse goiter? I think both can have diffuse goiter.

Use formula: protein excretion (g/day) = (protein/Cr ratio in mg/mg) * (urinary creatinine excretion per day in g). Approx 1 g creatinine per day. So 0.4 *1 =0.4 g = 400 mg. Another method: protein concentration mg/dL * urine volume L/day => 100 mg/dL * 1200 mL = 100 mg/dL * 12 dL = 1200 mg =1.2 g. But that ignores dilution. Usually estimated protein/creatinine ratio correlates with 24h protein excretion: protein(g)/day = protein/Cr (mg/mg) * 1.0 (g Cr/day). So answer 0.4 g.

Actually ureter descends into pelvis, but mostly in retroperitoneal abdominal cavity then enters pelvis. Saying \"urinary tract runs in abdominal cavity\" is inaccurate for pelvic portion. Likely false.\n\nb: ovarian artery arises from abdominal aorta directly, not renal artery. So false.\n\nc: round ligament of uterus is part of the broad ligament (ligamentum latum uteri), not the cardinal (uterosacral) ligament. The \"基靱帯\" likely means \"broad ligament\"? Actually Japanese \"基靱帯\" maybe \"ligamentum latum uteri (broad ligament)\". The round ligament is a component of the broad ligament. So c true.\n\nd: uterine artery arises from internal iliac artery (internal iliac = internal iliac, i.e., uterine branch). So internal iliac = internal iliac, not \"内腸骨動脈\" (internal iliac? The Japanese term for internal iliac artery is \"内腸骨動脈\". Yes, that is internal iliac. So uterine artery does branch from internal iliac artery. So d also true? Wait internal iliac is \"内腸骨動脈\". So d is correct as well. But question asks \"which is correct\" possibly only one. Need check: uterine artery originates from internal iliac artery (specifically anterior division). So d true.\n\nc also true. Which is more correct? Round ligament is part of broad ligament indeed. So both c and d true. Might be trick: round ligament is not part of cardinal ligament (基靱帯 is \"uterosacral ligament\"? Actually \"基靱帯\" maybe \"uterosacral ligament\" (sacrouterine). The round ligament is not part of cardinal (transverse cervical) nor uterosacral. It's in the broad ligament. So if \"基靱帯\" refers to \"uterosacral ligament\", then c false. Need translation: Japanese \"基靱帯\" literally \"base ligament\". I think \"基底靱帯\"? Not sure. Likely refers to \"broad ligament\" (基底? hmm). I'd choose d as only clear.\n\nThus answer d."

So \"7日間連続して貯血します\" meaning donate for 7 consecutive days - that's false because you cannot donate daily; need at least 2 weeks between donations. So a is incorrect.
