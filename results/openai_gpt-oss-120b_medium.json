The classic US findings for gallbladder carcinoma include: mass replacing the gallbladder, focal wall thickening, intraluminal polypoid mass >1 cm, invasion of liver bed, irregular wall thickening, loss of interface, etc. “Liver bed invasion” is a sign. So b is infiltration of the liver bed. Also \"polypoid lesion >1cm\" is suspect, but \"pedunculated lesion\" could be a polyp. However \"有茎性病変\" means pedunculated lesion (likely polyp). That could be carcinoma vs adenoma; but suspicion is for >1cm. But widely taught US sign for carcinoma is \"mass replacing gallbladder, focal wall thickening, or infiltration of liver bed\".

Graves disease: exophthalmos (yes), tremor (due to hyperthyroidism), pretibial myxedema (yes), cervical lymphadenopathy not typical, diffuse goiter typical. Painless thyroiditis (subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis) is a form of painless thyroiditis that can cause transient hyperthyroidism, then hypothyroidism. Features: painless diffuse goiter, may have mild hyperthyroid symptoms, not usually exophthalmos, not pretibial myxedema, tremor maybe due to hyperthyroidism but not typical? Actually tremor can be present with hyperthyroidism regardless of cause. So hand tremor could be present in both due to hyperthyroid state. Diffuse goiter also present in both. So options that are common: b (hand tremor) and e (diffuse goiter). Let's double-check: Pretibial myxedema and exophthalmos are specific to Graves due to autoimmune stimulation of TSH receptor in fibroblasts. Not in painless thyroiditis.

      "reasoning": "We need to interpret case: 42yo woman with ASD (atrial septal defect) diagnosed in childhood, likely ostium secundum. She now has dyspnea on exertion, fatigue. Physical exam: fixed splitting of S2, systolic ejection murmur at left sternal border 2nd intercostal, typical of ASD with increased flow across pulmonary valve. No cyanosis, no edema.\n\nIn ASD, over time leads to right heart volume overload, RV enlargement, pulmonary overcirculation. Shunt left-to-right initially. Over years can cause reversal (Eisenmenger) if pulmonary vascular resistance rises > systemic, causing right-to-left shunt, cyanosis, clubbing. At this stage, still left-to-right (symptomatic). What investigations? Options:\n\na) ECG with ST elevation - unlikely (ischemia).\n\nb) ECG with left ventricular hypertrophy - not typical; ASD leads to RV hypertrophy.\n\nc) Echocardiography showing right-to-left shunt dominance - not yet; still left-to-right.\n\nd) Chest X-ray showing left 2nd arch prominence (i.e., left atrial enlargement). In ASD, left atrial size? Usually, due to left-to-right shunt, left atrial may be normal, but right heart enlarged. Actually left atrium may be normal or mildly enlarged due to increased flow, but the hallmark on CXR is \"right ventricular enlargement\" and \"prominent pulmonary arteries\" and \"boot-shaped heart\"? Not boot shaped; that's Tetralogy. For ASD, you see \"enlarged pulmonary arteries\" and \"widened right heart border.\" \"Left second arch\" might refer to aortic knob? Not typical.\n\ne) Chest X-ray showing decreased pulmonary vascular markings (vascular attenuation) - That would be in Eisenmenger (right-to-left shunt) leading to decreased flow to lungs.\n\nGiven her symptoms and exam, probably still left-to-right shunt with increased pulmonary flow, so chest X-ray would show increased pulmonary vascular markings, not decreased. Thus e is wrong.\n\nWhat are plausible test findings? The best would be ECG showing right ventricular hypertrophy or right axis deviation. Not among options. Option b is left ventricular hypertrophy, which is not expected. Option c right-to-left shunt dominance - Not yet. Option d left 2nd arch prominence (maybe due to left atrial enlargement) - Not typical. However perhaps in ASD long-standing left-to-right shunt, left atrial size may be increased causing enlarged aortic knob? Actually left atrial enlargement leads to left atrial appendage and double density on right side of cardiac silhouette. The \"left second arch\" maybe refers to the aortic knob region (left second arch of aortic arch). In left-to-right shunt, pulmonary flow increased, so pulmonary arteries enlarge, especially the left pulmonary artery which runs near left 2nd arch? Not sure.\n\nLet's recall radiographic signs of ostium secundum ASD: \"enlarged pulmonary artery segment\", \"prominent right ventricular arch\", \"increased pulmonary vascular markings\", \"absence of left atrial enlargement\". The left ventricular size is normal.\n\nOption d \"胸部エックス線写真で左第2弓の突出\" possibly means \"prominent left 2nd arch\", which could refer to aortic knob? Not typical for ASD.\n\nOption e \"肺血管陰影の減弱\" indicates decreased pulmonary vascular markings, seen in Eisenmenger from large right-to-left shunt (pulmonary flow decreased). Not yet.\n\nThus none seem perfect, but maybe the correct answer is c? Let's think: The patient has ASD and now showing dyspnea and fatigue; may have progressed to Eisenmenger (right-to-left shunt) though no cyanosis yet. However she has no cyanosis, but early reversal could cause exertional desaturation? SpO2 97% stable. So likely still left-to-right.\n\nHowever question: \"この患者で予想される検査所見はどれか。\" Could ask which findings are expected in ASD with left-to-right shunt? Among given choices, maybe \"胸部エックス線写真で左第2弓の突出\" is referring to \"prominent pulmonary artery segment\"? The 2nd left arch maybe means \"second left arch\" which could be the pulmonary artery segment (left pulmonary artery)?? On PA chest X-ray, the \"second arch\" could be the aortic arch? Actually the \"aortic knob\" is left second arch (aortic arch). In ASD you may see a normal aortic knob, not prominent.\n\nMaybe they refer to \"第2肋間左胸骨縁の嗄音\" which is murmur. The X-ray showing \"左第2弓の突出\" might be \"prominent left upper mediastinal convexity\" reflecting enlarged pulmonary artery (Main PA) which is located near the left 2nd aortic arch? Hmm.\n\nLet's search memory: In ASD chest X-ray shows \"massive pulmonary artery segment (prone to knob) leading to a prominent left mediastinal silhouette at the level of the aortic knob\". Could be described as \"左第2肋間における血管影の突出\". So likely d is correct.\n\nThus answer: d.\n\nLet's choose d.\n\n"

In Cushing disease, low-dose dex fails to suppress; in adrenal adenoma, cortisol suppresses? For adrenal tumor (ACTH-independent), low-dose dex will suppress? Actually adrenal adenoma autonomous cortisol production, low-dose dex does not suppress because cortisol production is independent of pituitary ACTH; but high-dose dex might suppress? Wait: In adrenal adenoma, cortisol is autonomous, not suppressed by low dex, but dex suppression test is used to differentiate? Let's recall: 1 mg dex suppression test: In normal, cortisol suppressed <1.8 µg/dL. In Cushing syndrome (any cause) cortisol not suppressed.

Let's imagine: they performed retrograde angiography from left femoral artery up to pelvis shows disease at left common iliac artery? The question: which statements are wrong.\n\n① \"間欠性跛行だと思います\" - intermittent claudication is correct description. So ① is correct (not wrong). So a is not correct answer.\n\n② \"我が国では最近増加傾向にあります\" - prevalence of PAD is increasing due to aging and lifestyle. Likely true. So ② correct.\n\n③ \"左総腸骨動脈だと思います\" - The lesion location: Could be left external iliac artery or left common iliac? The angiogram described as left femoral artery retrograde to pelvic arteries. The typical location causing claudication of thigh? If lesion is at left common iliac artery, that could cause femoral-popliteal claudication. But need to know which is correct per image. Without image, but likely atherosclerotic occlusion at left common iliac artery? However, in many cases, superficial femoral artery lesion is common cause of claudication. The description says \"左大腿動脈から逆行性に造影した骨盤部の動脈造影\": from left thigh artery (likely femoral) retrograde to pelvic arteries. So they likely saw lesion in left internal iliac? But claudication is due to aortoiliac disease (Leriche syndrome) causing buttock, thigh pain. In this patient symptoms only left leg, not buttock. Could be left femoral artery disease. So statement \"左総腸骨動脈だと思います\" may be incorrect.\n\n④ \"ワルファリン投与を考えます\" - Anticoagulation with warfarin is not indicated for atherosclerotic PAD; antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel) is used. Warfarin could be used only for cardioembolic or hypercoagulable. So this is wrong.\n\n⑤ \"血管内治療を考えます\" - Endovascular therapy (angioplasty + stent) is indeed considered for aortoiliac lesions. So correct.\n\nThus incorrect statements: ③ and ④. The question asks \"下線部のうち、誤っているのはどれか。\" Only one choice? It lists a-e each corresponding to one number. So choose which number is incorrect.

If they did retrograde from left femoral to pelvic, they could see left common iliac occlusion. That fits with ABI low.\n\nBut typical claudication distance 300m suggests moderate disease; common iliac stenosis could cause. So maybe ③ correct.\n\nThus only ④ is wrong. Warfarin not used.

He had prior mild headache, diplopia, mild left ptosis for a few days. CT image is referenced (no actual image). Need to identify the most likely site of ruptured cerebral aneurysm based on CT findings (presumably blood pattern). Options: internal carotid artery, anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, posterior cerebral artery, vertebral artery.\n\nNeed to infer which location matches clinical signs (diplopia, ptosis) and CT pattern. Diplopia and ptosis on left suggests involvement of oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsy. That can be caused by posterior communicating artery aneurysm (a branch of internal carotid). So likely internal carotid artery (specifically posterior communicating artery). Among options, internal carotid artery (a) would be correct.\n\nAlso pattern of SAH: In anterior circulation, blood in basal cisterns, particularly perimesencephalic area? Posterior communicating aneurysm often compresses oculomotor nerve before rupture causing ptosis, diplopia.\n\nThus answer a.\n\nReturn format as specified."

Stool exam not needed as cause likely not parasitic. Legionella urine antigen? Not typical. So which is not appropriate? Both c and d are not needed. Which is more clearly not appropriate? Probably urine Legionella antigen is irrelevant to presentation. Stool direct smear also irrelevant because diarrhea could be due to other causes but not primary. But would you do stool exam?

But Legionella antigen also not indicated; there is no pneumonia signs, chest Xray normal, but Legionella can cause extrapulmonary? Typically pulmonary. Not indicated.\n\nWhich is \"適切でない\"?

The correct for interstitial cystitis is bladder distention (hydro-distention) which is basically bladder hydrostatic expansion (b). Option a might be \"bladder enlargement surgery\" which could be similar? Distinction: \"膀胱拡大術\" might refer to surgical bladder augmentation (using ileum) for low capacity bladder. That's more for neurogenic bladder, not interstitial cystitis. \"膀胱水圧拡張術\" is cystoscopic hydrodistention, which is a diagnostic and therapeutic for interstitial cystitis.\n\nThus answer b."

Options:\n\na) Bathing is possible.\n\nb) Oral intake is prohibited.\n\nc) Enteral nutrition infusion should be done with aseptic technique (sterile handling).\n\nd) Enteral nutrition can be used for several days after opening.\n\ne) Peristomal skin disinfected daily with povidone-iodine.\n\nWe need the correct one.\n\nGuidelines for gastrostomy button care: Patients can bathe/ shower, but keep tube site dry; you can cover with waterproof dressing. So a) likely true: bathing is allowed (with precautions).\n\nOral intake: After gastrostomy, you can give oral liquids if safe; not prohibited. So b false.\n\nEnteral feeding: Should use aseptic technique; handling feeding tube and formula should be done with hand hygiene, but not necessarily sterile; use clean technique (hand washing) but formulas are usually multi-dose (commercial). Aseptic (sterile) may be recommended to prevent infection. I think guidelines advise using aseptic technique (hand hygiene, wearing gloves, use of sterile syringes). So c could be true.\n\nd) Use of opened formula: Most commercial enteral formulas are preservative-free and require use within 24 hours of opening, stored in refrigerator. Some multi-dose containers can be used for 48h after opening if kept refrigerated. Not several days. So d false.\n\ne) Disinfect peristomal skin with povidone-iodine daily? Usually recommended to clean with mild soap and water; disinfectants like chlorhexidine may be used, but routine daily povidone-iodine may cause irritation. So likely false.\n\nThus which is \"correct\"? Possibly multiple? The question says 正しいのはどれか (which is correct). Usually single best answer.\n\nWe need to decide between a and c. Let's recall guidelines: For gastrostomy, feeding can be done with clean technique, not sterile (aseptic). The term \"無菌操作\" meaning sterile technique. Is that required? I think standard practice: Use aseptic technique (which includes hand washing, gloves, use of sterile equipment). Many sources: \"Enteral feeding should be administered with aseptic technique to prevent infection.\" So c seems correct.\n\nBut also a: Bathing is possible - is that allowed? Yes patients can bathe; the tube site must be protected. So also correct. Which one is more specific as a correct statement? The exam often expects that bathing is permitted with care; they might ask about restrictions. So a could be correct.\n\nLook at other options: b is false; d false; e false. So we have two potentially correct (a and c). Need to interpret nuance: \"無菌操作で行う\" might be too strict; recommended is \"clean technique\" not strictly sterile; but many guidelines: \"The administration set and feeding pump should be kept in a clean manner; frequent hand washing; use of sterile syringes for bolus feeds\". So maybe they consider that aseptic (無菌) is required. I think in Japanese exam, they differentiate \"無菌操作\" (sterile) vs \"清潔操作\" (clean). For enteral nutrition, generally clean (非無菌) is sufficient, because it's not an invasive procedure into sterile area (the tube is already inserted). So c may be considered false (they might say not required to be sterile). Therefore a is correct.\n\nThus answer: a."

      "reasoning": "We need to choose 2 likely test findings for this patient.\n\nLet's analyze case.\n\n63-year-old male, dyspnea on exertion, recent onset of palpitations, fatigue. History: tongue pain 6 months prior, no medical visit. 3 months ago dyspnea on stairs; 3 days ago palpitations, fatigue. No smoking. Had total gastrectomy for gastric cancer at age 50. Physical: anemia appearance conjunctiva pale, no jaundice. Tongue is pale pink, smooth surface (maybe glossitis). Heart: systolic ejection murmur at right sternal border 2nd intercostal space = maybe aortic stenosis? But he is 63, could have aortic sclerosis, not necessarily pathological. No lung findings. No edema.\n\nWe suspect anemia leading to dyspnea, palpitations. Causes: post-gastrectomy leading to vitamin B12 deficiency (causes macrocytic anemia). However his tongue appears smooth (glossitis) and pale, consistent with B12 deficiency. However B12 deficiency leads to macrocytosis (high MCV). The answer options: a LD high, b B12 low, c haptoglobin high, d MCV low, e eGFR low.\n\nWhich lab findings are predicted? B12 deficiency likely => low B12. That would be answer b. Also macrocytic anemia => high MCV, not low. So d is opposite. LD high? Could be hemolysis? Not likely. Haptoglobin high? Haptoglobin low in hemolysis. So not. eGFR low? Maybe chronic kidney disease causing anemia, but not indicated. Therefore only b seems correct.\n\nBut we need two correct answers. Maybe anemia due to iron deficiency (microcytic) from chronic blood loss? He had gastrectomy, may have malabsorption of iron, leading to iron deficiency anemia => low MCV (MCV low) (option d). Also low B12? Actually post-gastrectomy reduces intrinsic factor leading to B12 deficiency (macrocytic). Which is more likely? At 13 years after gastrectomy, B12 deficiency is common. Iron deficiency also possible due to reduced gastric acid causing less iron absorption. Both could be present. Need to infer from clinical features: Tongue smooth (glossitis) can be seen in B12 deficiency and iron deficiency? Glossitis is more classic for B12 deficiency. Also anemia is described as 'pale conjunctiva' but not mention of jaundice (no hemolysis). So likely macrocytic.\n\nThus we would select b (low B12) and maybe eGFR low? Not likely.\n\nCould LD high reflect tissue breakdown from anemia? Not typical. Haptoglobin high would be acute phase, not. So perhaps they expect that eGFR low because chronic kidney disease leads to anemia causing dyspnea and murmur (flow murmur). But no mention of hypertension, diabetes, edema. So unlikely.\n\nWhat else? The murmur is ejection systolic at right sternal border second intercostal, typical of aortic sclerosis/stenosis due to high-output due to anemia? Actually flow murmur can be heard in anemia. So they might attribute to anemia due to chronic disease (post gastrectomy). So answer would be low B12 and low MCV? Wait low B12 leads to macrocytosis (MCV high) not low. So maybe iron deficiency causing low MCV.\n\nBut glossitis in iron deficiency? It can cause atrophic glossitis (smooth tongue) also seen in iron deficiency. So both could cause. Which is more likely after gastrectomy? Iron deficiency due to reduced acid, also B12 deficiency due to intrinsic factor deficiency. At 13 years after surgery, B12 deficiency tends to appear after many years because body stores 3-4 years; after 13 years, deficiency common. So B12 deficiency maybe more typical.\n\nThus the two predicted lab findings: low B12 and high MCV (but they didn't list high MCV). They listed low MCV (d) which is opposite. So maybe they expect iron deficiency, giving low MCV. So they'd choose d and maybe something else like LD high? Wait LD high in hemolysis or tissue damage. Not typical for iron deficiency.\n\nHaptoglobin high? In iron deficiency no change.\n\neGFR low? Not related.\n\nThus perhaps they consider that postoperative anemia from chronic disease (i.e., decreased EPO) due to renal hypofunction (eGFR low). That's plausible? Post-gastrectomy not related.\n\nLet's re-evaluate options:\n\na LD high = indicates increased cell turnover, hemolysis, tissue necrosis. Not present.\n\nb Vit B12 low = plausible.\n\nc Haptoglobin high = acute phase protein, but not typical.\n\nd MCV low = microcytic anemia.\n\ne eGFR low = renal insufficiency.\n\nWe must pick two. The best two: b and d? Maybe they think iron deficiency anemia due to gastrectomy leads to low MCV and low B12 also could be low due to malabsorption of B12. Actually both could be low concurrently? It's possible to have combined deficiency. But B12 deficiency cause macrocytosis may mask microcytosis, but MCV might be normal. But exam likely expects: after total gastrectomy, you lose intrinsic factor, leading to B12 deficiency, causing macrocytic anemia => easy. However they didn't provide macrocytic option, but they might test that low B12 leads to macrocytic, not low MCV. So they'd only have b as correct, but they need 2. Maybe they expect also that LDH is high because B12 deficiency leads to ineffective erythropoiesis causing intramedullary hemolysis raising LDH. In megaloblastic anemia, LDH can be elevated due to increased cell turnover. Yes, LDH is often elevated in megaloblastic anemia due to intramedullary hemolysis. Also haptoglobin may be low (due to hemolysis). But they gave \"haptoglobin high\". So not that. So LD high could be correct.\n\nThus answer: a (LD high) and b (B12 low). Let's pick those.\n\nCheck: In B12 deficiency, labs: increased LDH, increased indirect bilirubin, low haptoglobin (since hemolysis). So LD high fits. Good.\n\nThus final answer: a, b."

Actually says \"発作性心房細動の停止時に最大８秒間の心停止\". So during termination of paroxysmal AF, there is sinus pause of up to 8 sec causing syncope. So this is sinus node dysfunction (tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome). She already started anticoagulation for AF. Treatment options: can give beta blocker? That may worsen brady. Calcium channel blocker also may cause brady, not good.\n\nCatheter ablation of AF could be considered to eliminate AF and thus prevent pauses, but if sinus node dysfunction persists, may still need pacing. For tachy-brady, guidelines: If symptomatic bradycardia/pause >3 sec, consider permanent pacemaker. However, if AF is the cause of tachy (and there is pause after termination), catheter ablation may be an option to treat AF and may resolve pauses. In guidelines, for patients with symptomatic bradycardia due to tachy-brady syndrome, options include sinus node dysfunction treatment with pacemaker, or ablation of AF if AF is primary and sinus node function likely recovers. So which are selectable? The question asks: after anticoagulation, which treatments are selectable? Probably both catheter ablation and pacemaker implantation are appropriate. Beta blockers and CCB are contraindicated due to pause. ICD is for ventricular arrhythmias, not indicated. So answer a? No. So choose c and d.\n\nBut need to verify guidelines: For patients with paroxysmal AF and symptomatic sinus pauses >3 sec, either catheter ablation or pacemaker; considered both.

Usually: 24h protein (g) = (urine protein concentration (mg/dL) / urine creatinine concentration (mg/dL)) * urinary creatinine excretion (g/day). But they give urine protein concentration 100 mg/dL, urine creatinine concentration 250 mg/dL. Also urine volume 1200 mL = 1.2 L = 1200 dL? Wait: 1 dL = 100 mL. So 1200 mL = 12 dL. Actually 1 dL = 100 mL, so 1200 mL = 12 dL. So total daily protein excretion = (protein conc mg/dL) * urine volume (dL) = 100 mg/dL * 12 dL = 1200 mg = 1.2 g. But they ask \"推定1日尿蛋白量\" using protein/creatinine ratio (Urine protein/creatinine ratio) times 1.0 g per g? Usually estimation: protein/creatinine ratio (mg/mg) approximates g protein per day. So ratio = 100/250 = 0.4 mg/mg = 0.4 g/g (since 1 mg/mg = 1 g/g). So estimated 24h protein = 0.4 g/g * 1.0? Actually typical: protein/creatinine ratio (mg/mg) multiplied by 1.0 (g/g) equals g protein per day. So answer 0.4 g/day.\n\nBut they ask provide three numbers? The format: \"①．②③ g/gCr\" unclear.

So maybe they want a number with one digit before decimal point and two digits after decimal, i.e., format X.YZ g/gCr. So we need to output, for example, \"0.40\".

Options describe primitive reflexes.\n\nWe need which reflex is observed at ~10 months.\n\na: Palmar grasp reflex (object in hand => strong grasp). This primitive reflex disappears by 3-4 months. So not at 10 months.\n\nb: Asymmetrical tonic neck reflex (ATNR): when head turned to side, the limbs on that side extend, opposite flex. Present at birth, disappears by 4-6 months. So not at 10 months.\n\nc: Cussler's reflex? Actually \"Moro\" reflex? \"Head drop, arms abduct and extend\"? The described: Supine, hand placed on head, then drop the head; upper limbs abduct and extend - that's the \"Moro reflex\" or startle reflex. Moro appears at birth, disappears by 3-6 months. So not at 10 months.\n\nd: \"Stepping\" or \"Walking\" reflex: When infant is held upright with feet on flat surface, they make stepping motions. This persists up to about 2 months? Actually stepping reflex present at birth, disappears by 2 months, reappears later (at around 9-12 months) as voluntary walking. The question: \"両脇を支えて床に足をつけると歩行するような動きをする。\" This is the \"walking\" or \"stepping\" reflex. Usually present up to 2 months, not at 10 months (as reflex). By 10 months, the stepping pattern is voluntary, not a reflex. But the description says \"when supported at both axillae with feet on floor, makes walking-like movements\". That is a primitive reflex, but disappears early. So not at 10 months.\n\ne: \"伸ばす\" - when the infant's head is suddenly thrown forward (head drop) in hanging position, he extends both arms. That sounds like the \"tonic neck reflex\"? Actually \"head drop\" into extension causes \"extensor tone\"? Could be \"landau reflex\" emerges at 3-4 months, present until 12 months. Landau: when infant prone, lifts head, trunk forms convex arc (extension of spine). Not described.\n\nAnother reflex: \"Babinski\" emerges later (3 months). Not.\n\nOption e might be \"Moro\"? Wait \"懸垂位で頭を急に床に投げ出すように向けると両手を伸ばす\". This is the \"Moro reflex\" (startle) but in hanging (suspension) position, sudden head drop causes arm extension. That's the \"Moro reflex\". It disappears by 4-6 months. So not at 10 months.\n\nWhich one is present at 10 months? Maybe the \"asymmetric tonic neck reflex\" disappears earlier. Could be that the only reflex still present is the \"Moro\"? No.\n\nMaybe they consider the \"Stepping\" reflex persists until walking is learned (~12 months). Some texts say stepping reflex disappears by 2 months, but some say it reappears as voluntary stepping later. However as reflex, not present at 10 months. But the question likely expects answer d because they want the stepping reflex being present up to 12 months as a primitive reflex? Let's check typical pediatric reflex timeline: Primitive Reflexes:\n- Rooting: present at birth, disappears by 4 months.\n- Sucking: present at birth, disappears by 4 months.\n- Moro: present at birth, disappears by 5-6 months.\n- Palmar grasp: present at birth, disappears by 3-4 months.\n- Plantar grasp: by 6 months.\n- Babinski: up to 12 months? Actually extensor plantar response present at birth, disappears by 12-24 months.\n- Asymmetric tonic neck (ATNR): present at birth, disappears by 6 months.\n- Symmetric tonic neck (STNR): appears at 6-9 months, disappears by 12 months.\n- Tonic labyrinthine: appears 1-2 months, disappears 3-4 months.\n- Walking/stepping: present at birth, disappears by 2 months.\n\nThus none of listed are present at 10 months except maybe \"Symmetric tonic neck reflex\" or \"Landau\". But those are not listed.\n\nOption b describes ATNR. Option c describes Moro. Option a describes grasp. Option d described stepping. Option e maybe \"Babinski\"? Not. So maybe trick: The only reflex that persists at 10 months is the plantigrade stepping due to voluntary but they still call it \"reflex\"? In exam likely answer d.\n\nLet's choose d."

In many guidelines, patient autonomy overrides. But still discuss? The question asks \"今後の対応で最も適切なのはどれか。\" The best is respect patient wishes. But if patient refuses, you don't force ventilation.

PaCO2 normal 38 (not hypercapnic). High WBC 16,460 neutrophils, CRP 10.1. Possible acute COPD exacerbation due to bacterial infection. Treatment: supplemental O2, antibiotics, bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids. Also consider prophylactic anticoagulation for hospitalized patients (esp. elderly, immobilized) but risk vs benefit. However they have no DVT signs, D-dimer low, not high risk of VTE? In COPD exacerbation, prophylactic anticoagulation is generally recommended unless contraindicated due to bleeding risk. But is it appropriate? Usually hospitalized patients receive prophylactic low molecular weight heparin subcut. The option d: \"ヘパリン持続点滴\" (heparin continuous IV infusion) – for prophylaxis they'd give subQ low-dose heparin, not continuous IV infusion, which is for therapeutic anticoagulation. This may be unnecessary.\n\nCheck other options: a) Fluids - Is IV fluid appropriate? He is not hypotensive; BP 146/78, no signs of dehydration, but may need fluids for sepsis? Yet COPD exacerbation may cause tachycardia due to hypoxemia; fluid overload could worsen respiratory status especially in elderly. Usually fluid administration is cautious; but not automatically needed. However guidelines: patients with COPD exacerbation may have normal volume status; IV fluids not routinely required unless signs of dehydration or other.\n\nb) Antibiotics - Indicated due to increased sputum purulence, fever, increased dyspnea.

Present findings: diplopia, limited upward gaze of left eye (i.e., left superior rectus or inferior oblique dysfunction?). Actually upward gaze involves several muscles innervated by oculomotor nerve (CN III) — superior rectus, inferior oblique, plus levator palpebrae superioris. But limited upward gaze could indicate damage to oculomotor nerve. Also periorbital sensory loss (V1 distribution) suggests involvement of the ophthalmic branch of trigeminal nerve. No nasal deformity or epistaxis, no open mouth, no malocclusion. So sign suggest orbital floor (blowout) fracture (i.e., orbital floor or medial wall) causing entrapment of inferior rectus (downward gaze limitation) but here upward gaze limitation? Actually in orbital floor fracture, the inferior rectus is trapped, leading to limitation of upward gaze (can't look up because inferior rectus is restricted). Yes, typical \"blowout fracture\" causing diplopia worsens on upward gaze due to entrapment of inferior rectus. Also infraorbital nerve hypoesthesia causing numbness of cheek, upper lip (V2), but here they mention left periorbital sensation decreased (could be V1). However orbital floor fracture can affect infraorbital nerve (V2). Could be orbital roof fracture leading to oculomotor nerve palsy? Let’s recall: orbital roof fracture may cause superior orbital fissure syndrome (cranial nerve III, IV, V1, VI) leading to ophthalmoplegia, diplopia, sensory loss V1. Upward gaze limitation could also be due to superior rectus involvement. But common cause after blunt trauma is orbital floor blowout fracture (inferior wall) causing entrapment of inferior rectus leading to limited elevation (upward gaze). The sensory loss is in V2 (infraorbital). Their note \"左眼周囲の感覚の低下\" - around the left eye sensory decrease, maybe V1 area. But still consistent with orbital floor fracture? Not exactly. However orbital roof fracture would involve V1 and CN III causing vertical gaze issue. But roof fracture often accompanied by raccoon eyes, blood in the orbit, CSF rhinorrhea, etc. Also would be more severe.\n\nGiven answer choices: a concussion, b mandible fracture, c spinal cord injury, d nasal bone fracture, e orbital floor fracture (眼窩底骨折).

We must consider acute cholangitis vs cholecystitis vs hepatitis etc. The patient has right upper quadrant pain, fever, jaundice (mild scleral icterus), labs: cholestatic pattern: ALP 360, GGT 240, bilirubin 3.2, modest transaminases. Leukocytosis. Likely acute cholangitis or acute cholecystitis. The diagnosis likely acute cholangitis (Charcot's triad: RUQ pain, fever, jaundice). So relevant interview items: ① time of onset and relation to meals? RUQ pain after dinner suggests biliary colic. That's relevant. ② Persistence of symptoms. Relevant. ③ Absence of right shoulder pain (referred pain) maybe also relevant? Not sure. ④ No prior stone attack history. That might be less directly diagnostic; but history of gallstones predisposes to cholecystitis, but not having prior attacks may not significantly alter diagnosis? ⑤ Vaccination history is irrelevant to this diagnosis.\n\nThus the item that does NOT directly contribute is likely ⑤ vaccination history. So answer e.\n\nCheck other possibilities: ③ absence of right shoulder pain. In acute cholecystitis, there can be right shoulder pain radiation (Kehr sign?). Usually right shoulder pain is more typical of diaphragmatic irritation (e.g., subphrenic abscess) but not essential. However it's still part of symptom assessment. But the question: which does NOT directly contribute to diagnosis? Vaccination history certainly not. So answer e.\n\nThus final output: 【回答】e"

Actually TB patients hospitalization is under \"結核予防法\"? There is \"結核予防法\" (Tuberculosis Prevention Act). But the question mentions \"検疫法\" (Quarantine Act). The quarantine law deals with infectious diseases and sets measures, but TB maybe not. I think TB is under \"結核予防法\". So a is likely incorrect.\n\n- \"未熟児の養育医療\" (medical care for premature infants) is covered under \"生活保護法\"? There is \"未熟児の医療費助成\" under \"母子保健法\"? Actually in Japan, medical expenses for preterm infants (including NICU) are covered by \"健康保険法\" partly, but there is also a system called \"未熟児等医療費助成制度\" that is based on \"母子健康法\"? Not sure. But I think it's not under \"生活保護法\". So b likely wrong.\n\n- \"精神障害者の措置入院\" (involuntary hospitalization) is under \"精神保健福祉法\"? There is \"精神保健福祉法\" which governs involuntary admission (措置入院). Yes, that is correct. So c likely correct.\n\n- \"指定難病医療費助成制度\" is a designated intractable disease medical expense assistance under \"健康保険法\"? Designated intractable disease (指定難病) system is regulated by \"医療保険法\"? Actually the system is set by the \"厚生労働省告示\" and \"指定難病医療費助成制度\" is based on \"健康保険法\" (Health Insurance Act) maybe. But I think it's under \"厚生労働省令\" but or the \"医療保険法\"? Let's recall: The \"指定難病医療費助成制度\" (Designated Intractable Disease Medical Expense Assistance) is a public assistance system for patients with designated intractable diseases, provided based on the \"医療保険法\"? Actually the intractable disease system is under \"健康保険法\" article 55? I think the designated disease system is established under the \"健康保険法\" and \"国民健康保険法\". So d could also be correct.\n\nBut the question asks \"the combination that is correct\". Perhaps only one correct answer. Which among c, d, maybe others, is most accurate.\n\nCheck e: \"小児慢性特定疾病医療費助成制度\" (child chronic specific disease medical expense assistance) under \"障害者自立支援法\"? That seems unlikely; it's probably under \"小児慢性特定疾病医療費助成制度\" is part of \"児童福祉法\"? Not disability autonomy act. So e wrong.\n\nThus candidate c or d.\n\nNeed verify specifics: The designated intractable disease assistance system was established by \"厚生労働省告示\" pursuant to \"医療保険法\" (maybe). I'm leaning c is clearly correct and unambiguous. The other could be arguable but likely they'd consider d incorrect because the basis is not \"健康保険法\" but \"厚生労働省告示\" under \"医療保険法\". But exam expects \"健康保険法\"? Let's recall actual Japanese medical law: Article 76-3 of the Health Insurance Act provides for \"designated intractable disease medical expense subsidy\". So maybe it's indeed health insurance law. Check memory: The \"指定難病医療費助成制度\" is stipulated in the \"厚生労働省令\" (Ministry ordinance) and the \"健康保険法\" article 110-2? I'm not sure.\n\nBut given typical board exam, they might consider d correct as well. However they likely have only one correct answer. Which one is most definitively correct? c is certainly correct.

The act sets provisions for medical licensing examinations, registration, medical practice, etc. The \"Common test\" (CBT, OSCE) is part of the new medical national exam? Actually, the common test (共通試験) refers to the \"Common Examination for Medical and Dental Licensure\" (共通試験) introduced recently, consisting of CBT and OSCE, governed by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Is it in the 医師法? I think the Medical Practitioners Act includes the \"medical national exam\" (医師国家試験) and its methods. The CBT/OSCE is a part of that exam, but the law may not specifically mention CBT/OSCE, just \"医師国家試験\". The act may not have detailed provisions about CBT/OSCE, but it does regulate the \"医師国家試験\". However question likely expects that \"共用試験（CBT、OSCE）\" is not regulated by the Medical Practitioners Act because it's a new format and not specified.

Actually, clinical training (研修医) is regulated by the Medical Practitioners Act? There is the \"医師の研修\" in the act: Article 34 (something) about \"医師の研修\" maybe.

In female pelvis, ureters descend from the kidneys into the pelvis, pass in the retroperitoneal space, then go into the bladder. They run in the pelvic cavity (intraperitoneal? Actually ureter is retroperitoneal, not intraperitoneal). It says \"尿管は腹腔内を走行する。\" Means ureter runs within the abdominal cavity. The ureter passes through the pelvic brim into the true pelvis, but it is still retroperitoneal, meaning outside the peritoneal cavity, but still within the abdominal cavity (retroperitoneal). However the phrase \"腹腔内\" generally refers to within the peritoneal cavity? In Japanese medical terminology, \"腹腔内\" often means intraperitoneal cavity. Since ureter is retroperitoneal, not intraperitoneal, so statement is false.\n\nb) Ovarian artery arises from the renal artery. Actually ovarian artery arises directly from the abdominal aorta, just inferior to the renal artery, not from renal artery. So false.\n\nc) \"子宮円索は基靱帯の一部を構成する。\" The round ligament of uterus (ligamentum teres uteri) is considered part of the broad ligament (basement ligament? Actually \"基靱帯\" is the \"broad ligament\" (broad ligament = \"基底靱帯\"? In Japanese \"基底靱帯\" is broad ligament). The round ligament is attached in the free edge of the broad ligament. The round ligament is a structure that courses within the broad ligament, but is it considered part of the broad ligament? Many sources say the round ligament is a component of the broad ligament (specifically a cord in the free margin). So statement likely true.\n\nd) Uterine artery arises from the internal iliac (internal iliac is \"内腸骨動脈\"? Wait internal iliac artery in Japanese is \"内腸骨動脈\". Yes. The uterine artery arises from the internal iliac (specifically from the anterior division). So this is true. Wait there are two possibilities: uterine artery is a branch of internal iliac (anterior division). So statement d is true.\n\nBut we can only choose one correct answer. Maybe one is more precise: Actually uterine artery arises from internal iliac (formerly called \"internal iliac artery\" not \"internal pudendal\" etc). So d is correct.\n\nWhat about c? There may be nuance: The round ligament is not part of the \"broad ligament\" proper, but rather runs within it; but the question may state it's part of the \"ligamentum latum uteri\" (broad ligament). Some textbooks consider round ligament as a derivative of the fetal gubernaculum, attached to the uterus at its junction with the uterine tube. It passes through the broad ligament. It is considered part of the \"broad ligament\" (i.e., one component). So c could also be correct.\n\nThus there may be more than one correct option, but problem says choose which is correct, implying only one.\n\nLet's verify each statement more strictly.\n\na) The ureter runs in the \"retroperitoneal\" space - not within the peritoneal cavity (腹腔内). So false.\n\nb) Ovarian artery arises from aorta, not renal artery. false.\n\nc) The uterine round ligament is a component of the \"ligamentum latum uteri\" (broad ligament). In Japanese, \"基靱帯\" is the \"broad ligament\". I think they accept that round ligament is part of the broad ligament. So statement true.\n\nd) Uterine artery arises from internal iliac (内腸骨動脈). This is also true. However sometimes uterine artery arises from internal iliac (or from the anterior division). So d also true.\n\ne) Douglas pouch (pouch of Douglas) is the rectouterine pouch, which is between the uterus and rectum, not between uterus and bladder. So false.\n\nThus there are at least two true statements: c and d. Which one is considered correct in typical Japanese exam? Let's recall typical teaching: Uterine artery: branch from internal iliac artery. That's a standard fact. So d is definitely correct.\n\nRound ligament being part of broad ligament maybe considered as \"broad ligament has three parts: mesosalpinx, mesovarium, mesometrium. The round ligament is not part of the broad ligament but lies within the free edge of the broad ligament.\" Some might consider it not as part of \"基靱帯\" but rather runs in it. The wording \"子宮円索は基靱帯の一部を構成する。\" Might be considered false because round ligament is not part of the broad ligament; it runs in it but is distinct. Many exam sources say round ligament is NOT a part of the broad ligament but passes within it. Example: In anatomy, the round ligament is located in the free border of the broad ligament and is considered a structure of the broad ligament. I'm not fully sure.\n\nLet's check Japanese textbooks: \"子宮円索は基底靱帯の自由縁に位置し、基底靱帯の一部として記載されることがある。\" Some sources call it \"基底靱帯の構成要素\". Might be accepted.\n\nBut which answer would exam key pick? Usually they'd have only one correct. Since d is unambiguously correct, they'd likely choose d.\n\nThus answer d.\n\nCheck e: Douglas窩 (pouch) is between uterus and rectum, not bladder. So false.\n\nSo final answer: d.\n\nLet's output."

I think measles is \"category 4\" maybe not. Let's search memory: In Japan, the Infectious Disease Control Law requires immediate (within 24 hours) reporting for some diseases: plague, cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid, cholera, dysentery, etc. Measles is \"Category 1 disease (Infectious disease designated by law) requiring \"immediate report\" within 24 hours?

Mother has anxiety and sleep deprivation. Baby weight 3400g at 1 month, birth weight 3300g. So weight gain only 100g in ~1 month, which is insufficient. Normal weight gain ~150-200g per week (i.e., about 600-800g in a month). So insufficient weight gain. Also feeding pattern seems prolonged per feeding (30-40 min) but short intervals (1-2 hours). Possibly baby is not getting enough milk per feed due to short intervals leading to insufficient volume. Might need to increase duration/interval? Actually typical newborn feeds about 8-12 times per day, intervals 2-3 hours, each 20-30 min. Here 1-2 hour intervals is too frequent, may not allow adequate milk letdown/volume per feed, leading to insufficient intake. Advice: increase interval between feeds (i.e., reduce frequency) not necessarily increase duration. But question options:\n\na \"Give glucose water\" - not needed unless failure to thrive severe.\n\nb \"Mother's lack of affection\" - not correct.\n\nc \"Add formula\" - formula supplementation, maybe if insufficient intake; but first step is to improve breastfeeding technique.\n\nd \"Increase feeding frequency\" - Actually frequency is already high, need to decrease frequency? So not correct.\n\ne \"Extend feeding time\" - each feeding 30-40 min which is already long. But maybe baby is not actively nursing effectively; but extension may help.\n\nI think proper advice: \"授乳回数を増やしましょう\" is wrong. \"授乳時間を延ばしましょう\" may not be needed; already long. Better is to \"授乳間隔を伸ばしましょう\" but not an option. So among options, which is most appropriate? Possibly \"人工乳を追加しましょう\" if infant is failing to gain weight. However first line is to assess breastfeeding adequacy, maybe improve latch and allow baby to feed longer and less often. But options limited.\n\nGiven mother is anxious and sleep deprived; increasing frequency would worsen, not helpful. Adding formula might relieve mother, but not ideal first.\n\nBut the question likely testing that infant is not gaining weight due to low volume feed; you should increase feeding time (extend) not increase frequency. So answer e. However feeding time already 30-40 min, typical. Maybe they think 30-40 min is long, but actual effective nursing maybe less, but extending may not help. The key is \"授乳回数を増やす\" would be wrong; \"授乳時間を延ばす\" might increase milk intake per session (or make sure baby empties breasts). So e is best.\n\nThus answer: e.\n\n"

      "reasoning": "We need to determine appropriate counseling for a woman with essential hypertension on calcium channel blocker (CCB) planning pregnancy. In pregnancy, certain antihypertensives are contraindicated (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, direct renin inhibitors) due to fetal toxicity. Calcium channel blockers (like nifedipine) are generally considered safe in pregnancy. The issue is that with well-controlled BP, some guidelines suggest continuing medication during pregnancy, especially if BP is above target (e.g., >150/100). However, mild hypertension (BP <140/90) generally does not require medication during pregnancy. In preconception counseling, it is recommended to discontinue antihypertensives that are teratogenic (ACEi, ARBs) and to switch to safer agents if needed. Calcium channel blockers (like nifedipine) are considered safe and can be continued. So appropriate explanation: \"妊娠したら降圧薬を中止しましょう\" is not correct because she is on CCB, which is safe. \"今から降圧薬は中止しましょう\" might be okay? Usually if BP is well-controlled with medication, could stop before conception? But guidelines often recommend switching to a safe drug before conception if needed. Since CCB is safe, it can be continued through pregnancy. So answer c: \"妊娠しても現在の治療を継続しましょう\". Check other options: a would stop drug now; not needed. b switch to methyldopa (which is safe) - could also be an option, but not necessary if current drug is safe. However some guidelines recommend using labetalol or methyldopa as first-line in pregnancy; but calcium channel blockers are also acceptable. The question asks appropriate explanation to the couple concerned about impact of antihypertensive therapy. The best is that the current medication (CCB) is safe and can be continued if needed. So answer c.\n\nThus final output format: 【回答】c"

That would be at 12-15 months. The child is 1 yr 2 mo → 14 months approx. So due for 4th dose maybe. However schedule: In Japan, PCV13 is given at 2, 4, 6 months, booster at 12-15 months.

So can't give again.\n\n- Varicella vaccine: first dose at 12-23 months (1st). So she got it 10 days ago, so can't give second dose yet. The second dose is at 15 months? Actually schedule: 2 doses, 1st at 12-15 months, second at 4-6 years? Wait time: The recommended schedule for varicella in Japan is two doses: first at 12-15 months, second at 4-6 years.

Actually they ask: \"受診当日に接種可能で、かつ定期接種のワクチンはどれか。\" Means \"Which vaccine can be given on the day of visit and also is a routine immunization?\" So need both conditions: not contraindicated (no illness) and it's a scheduled routine vaccine per age.\n\nNow evaluate each option.\n\na: waterpox vaccine second dose. Not due (second dose given at 4-6 years). So not scheduled now. So not correct.\n\nb: mumps vaccine first dose. Mumps vaccine is usually given as part of MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) combination? In Japan, separate MMR not used; they use MR (measles-rubella) separate from mumps? Actually mumps vaccine is given separately (MM vaccine) at 12-24 months? Wait schedule: Japan includes \"mumps vaccine\" as part of \"MM\" (measles-mumps) combined? Actually \"MMR\" not used. Mumps vaccine recommended at 12-15 months as single antigen? There is a mumps vaccine (live attenuated) given at 12-24 months (first dose) and booster at 5-7 years. However many children receive combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) but not in Japan? In Japan, measles and rubella combined vaccine (MR) and mumps vaccine separate, so first mumps dose at 12-24 months (1st). In this child, she got measles-rubella vaccine 10 days ago, not mumps. So she hasn't gotten mumps vaccine yet. So she is eligible for mumps vaccine first dose now (it can be given concurrently with MR? Usually live vaccines can be given at same time? Not concurrently? Typically you can give MMR and varicella together; but giving MR and separate mumps? There's recommendation that separate live vaccines can be given at same visit? In Japan, they can be given at same time, but there may be a recommendation not to give multiple live vaccines on same day? Actually guidelines allow co-administration of live attenuated vaccines at different sites if needed. For example, MR and varicella can be given simultaneously. So she can receive mumps vaccine first dose now. However is mumps part of routine immunization schedule? Yes, mumps vaccine is part of routine schedule (定期接種). So b could be correct.\n\nc: influenza vaccine first dose. Not part of routine schedule; also may be out of season. So likely not correct.\n\nd: pediatric pneumococcal vaccine 4th dose (booster). She is 14 months, due for booster (4th dose). This is routine. She has had prior PCV doses? Not mentioned, but likely she had them earlier per schedule. The record says \"予防接種は順調に接種され\" meaning they've been up to date; so she has received prior 3 PCV doses at 2, 4, 6 months. So 4th dose due now at 12-15 months. So can be given.\n\nNow which one is possible and also routine? Both b and d satisfy. However question asks which vaccine (single answer) is possible to administer on same day AND is a routine vaccination. Maybe only one of the options fits because of interaction with recent live vaccine given 10 days ago. Since she received MR (live) and varicella (live) 10 days ago. There could be a contraindication to give another live vaccine within 4 weeks? There is recommendation about interval between live vaccines: If two live vaccines are given, there should be at least 4 weeks interval unless they are scheduled to be given together. However they can be given simultaneously but not within 4 weeks separately. She got MR and varicella 10 days ago, both live attenuated. Giving mumps vaccine (live) now would be within 4 weeks after a live vaccine, which may be contraindicated unless given at same visit. Since they were not given together, it's less than 4 weeks, thus not recommended. So mumps vaccine first dose cannot be given now because of recent live vaccines.\n\nWhat about PCV? It's a conjugate vaccine (inactivated). That can be given at any time even after live vaccines. So d is permissible.\n\nThus correct answer: d.\n\nCheck other options: waterpox second dose also live but not due anyway. Influenza is inactivated (but not routine). The question specifically says \"定期接種\". So d is the only that meets both criteria.\n\nTherefore answer: d.\n\nReturn format \"【回答】d\"."

Primary prevention: actions to prevent onset of disease, before disease occurs. In this patient, they have hypertension, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Primary prevention would be measures to prevent first occurrence of disease (e.g., stroke, MI). Use of antihypertensive medication: that's secondary prevention? Actually hypertension is a risk factor; treating hypertension to prevent CVD is considered primary prevention? In guidelines, controlling blood pressure in people without established cardiovascular disease is primary prevention of CVD. So medication is primary prevention for CVD. Counseling for insomnia? Not directly. Exercise class: primary prevention for many conditions like sarcopenia, cardiovascular disease. Participation in regular exercise is primary prevention. Smoking cessation (or switching to heated tobacco) - that might be harm reduction but not cessation; is that primary prevention? Smoking is a risk factor; switching to heated tobacco may reduce risk but still risk; but primary prevention would be quitting smoking. Changing to heated tobacco is not proven beneficial, maybe considered secondary? Probably not classified as primary prevention.\n\nOccasional drinking: moderate alcohol maybe protective?

      "reasoning": "We need to interpret case. 35yo woman, infertility. History: 1 year married, unprotected intercourse about once a month, mild dyspareunia. Menarche 12, cycles 30-40 days, regular, 6 days, no dysmenorrhea. Basal body temperature biphasic (indicates ovulation). Physical: uterus normal size, adnexa not palpable. Labs: LH normal, FSH normal, prolactin normal low, estradiol normal mid-range, testosterone normal. So ovulatory cycles. Husband semen normal. So likely tubal factor (maybe bilateral tubal obstruction). They mention hysterosalpingography images (not provided). Probably show bilateral tubal obstruction (e.g., no spill). So diagnosis: tubal factor infertility.\n\nTreatment options: Artificial insemination (IUI) works if semen normal but tubal factor would need IVF. So IUI not appropriate when tubal obstruction present. Option a: Artificial insemination (IUI). Not appropriate.\n\n卵管形成術 (tubal reconstructive surgery) may be considered if obstruction not too severe, but at age 35 may be considered? In tubal factor, surgery may be attempted if distal obstruction and tubes are salvageable. However imaging maybe shows bilateral hydrosalpinx? If so, IVF recommended. Need decide which is not appropriate.\n\nc: timing intercourse guidance - she has intercourse once per month (maybe not timed). Can counsel to have intercourse every 2-3 days around ovulation. That is appropriate.\n\nd: clomiphene (Clomiphene) used for ovulatory dysfunction; she is ovulating, so not indicated.\n\ne: gonadotropin therapy (gonadotropins) again for ovulation induction, not needed.\n\nThus which is NOT appropriate? Multiple options may be not appropriate. The question: \"治療で適切でないのはどれか。\" Means which treatment is not appropriate. Among options, we need to choose one that is not appropriate for this case. Considering tubal factor, options that target ovulation (c, d, e) may be unnecessary. However timing intercourse is always appropriate basic. Even with tubal factor, timing intercourse is still beneficial but may not solve tubal occlusion. But still advisable. Usually, if tubal obstruction, artificial insemination, ovarian stimulation won't help. So the not appropriate choices include artificial insemination, clomiphene, gonadotropins. Which single? The most obviously inappropriate is artificial insemination because it requires patent tubes. Also clomiphene/gonadotropins are for anovulation which she does not have, so also inappropriate. The question likely expects to identify tubal factor and choose artificial insemination as not appropriate.\n\nLet's check typical Japanese exam style: They list various treatments, choose which is not suitable. In tubal factor, appropriate treatments are tubal surgery (if feasible) and IVF (not listed). IUI is not appropriate. Also ovulation induction not appropriate. However they might consider that because she has regular cycles, ovulation induction not needed. So both d and e are not appropriate. Which is more obviously not appropriate? Usually they'd consider that clomiphene is used for anovulation, so not indicated -> not appropriate. Same for gonadotropin. But IUI is also not indicated because tubes blocked. Possibly they want the one that is clearly not appropriate: artificial insemination (a) as tubal factor. Let's consider answer pattern: Usually a single best answer. Evaluate each:\n\na IUI -> requires at least unilateral patency; not suitable.\n\nb Tubal reconstructive surgery -> may be appropriate if tubes obstructed and salvageable, but depends. Might be indicated.\n\nc Intercourse timing -> always recommended as basic, even with tubal factor, but still appropriate.\n\nd Clomiphene -> for anovulation; not needed -> not appropriate.\n\ne Gonadotropin -> similar.\n\nWhich is more \"不適切\" (inappropriate) given that she is ovulatory? Both d and e are for ovulation induction. However they could be used in combination with IUI for ovulation induction? But if tubes blocked, still not helpful.\n\nMaybe the question expects you to note that \"人工授精\" (artificial insemination) is not suitable because tubal factor, while other options (b, c) are appropriate. Regarding d/e, they are also not appropriate but they might be considered if ovulation induction needed for timed intercourse? But still not needed. However exam may consider that clomiphene could be used for infertility even when ovulatory but to increase chance? Not typical. Clomiphene only for anovulation.\n\nThus answer likely a. Let's answer a.\n\n"

Usually low attenuation, not artifact.\n\nLet's examine each:\n\n① 経鼻経管栄養 (nasogastric tube). A tube made of radiopaque material? Usually NG tube may cause artifact if it's metallic? Usually it's plastic but with a radiopaque line; minimal artifact.\n\n② 気腫性変化が著明 (severe emphysema). This leads to low attenuation, maybe cause artifacts like overprojection?

Pacemaker (metal) and motion (cannot stay still) cause artifact. Also aortic calcification can cause beam hardening but less likely considered artifact? CT may show streak artifact near calcification but usually can be compensated. The typical Japanese exam for artifact includes \"metallic foreign bodies\" and \"patient motion\".

Not typical \"artifact\" but \"beam hardening artifact\" caused by high-attenuation structures like calcified bone/contrast.

Ultrasound shows no retained placenta or blood collection in uterus, but there is massive fluid collection in areas A, B, C (likely peritoneal spaces) per separate material. This suggests postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony? But there is little bleeding from uterus; massive intra-abdominal fluid suggests hemoperitoneum possibly from uterine rupture or laceration of uterine vessels (e.g., uterine rupture, laceration of uterine arteries). Prior myomectomy increases risk of uterine rupture. At 1 hour after delivery, she collapses. Intra-abdominal bleeding, not vaginal.\n\nThus management: immediate surgical exploration: laparotomy (open) and hemostasis. Options: b \"開腹止血術\" (laparotomy hemostasis).

However could be attempted while preparing surgery? The question asks \"適切な処置はどれか。2つ選べ。\" Usually in postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine rupture, immediate laparotomy is indicated.

Let's verify typical management guidelines: When postpartum hemorrhage is due to uterine rupture with intra-abdominal bleeding, immediate laparotomy and hemostasis; also need blood transfusion. So answer a and b.\n\nCheck other options: c uterine compression not effective, d embolization not immediate enough, e balloon tamponade not for intra-abdominal. So answer a,c?

Sensory: left lower limb loss of temperature and pain (spinothalamic), but vibration and proprioception intact. Right lower limb loss of vibration and proprioception (dorsal column) but temperature intact.\n\nThus we have dissociated sensory deficits: contralateral loss of pain/temp (spinothalamic crosses within a few segments) and ipsilateral loss of dorsal column. Motor UMN signs ipsilateral. This pattern suggests lesion in spinal cord affecting one side (hemicord) i.e., Brown-Sequard syndrome. The side of lesion: Right hemicord lesion would cause ipsilateral (right) motor weakness and dorsal column loss, and contralateral (left) loss of pain/temp. Exactly matches findings: right lower limb weakness (right motor), right dorsal column loss (vibration, proprioception), left pain/temp loss. So lesion is right half of spinal cord at level affecting lower limb: that would be spinal cord (right half) likely at thoracic level (since lower limb). Among options: a small cerebellar vermis, b left lateral medulla, c right lateral medulla, d spinal cord left half, e spinal cord right half. Answer e.\n\nThus answer e.\n\nCheck that left lower limb has loss of temperature but not vibration, that's classic Brown-Sequard. The lesion is right half.\n\nThus answer: e.\n\n"

      "reasoning": "We need to interpret case. 28yo woman with unilateral leg paresis, contralateral sensory deficits: Right leg weakness with hyperreflexia, Babinski (+) indicates UMN lesion on right side (i.e., left side of brain or spinal cord above lesion). Sensory: left leg loss of temperature/pain (spinothalamic), right leg loss of vibration/position (dorsal column). So dissociated sensory deficits: contralateral loss of pain/temp (spinothalamic) and ipsilateral loss of proprioception suggests lesion in left spinal cord (Brown-Sequard). However motor deficit is on right side, not left; in Brown-Sequard, you get ipsilateral UMN signs below lesion. Here motor deficit is on right, while pain loss is left, proprio loss right. That's classic for lesion of left side of spinal cord? Let's check: In Brown-Sequard, left hemi-section -> ipsilateral (left) motor weakness (corticospinal) and ipsilateral dorsal column loss; contralateral (right) pain/temp loss. So not matching.\n\nOur case shows right motor weakness (ipsilateral to proprio loss) and left pain loss. That matches left side lesion? Wait: Right motor weakness = ipsi to right side? Actually motor weakness is on right side, so the corticospinal tract that decussates at medullary pyramids, so lesion above decussation leads to contralateral weakness. Since lesion likely in brain (cortex or internal capsule) giving contralateral weakness (right side weakness means left brain). For dorsal column: dorsal column fibers ascend ipsilaterally and cross at medulla. So a left cortical lesion would not affect dorsal column (since peripheral). But central lesion like left thalamus could cause sensory deficits contralaterally possibly with specific patterns. The pattern: left leg loss of pain/temp (contralateral to motor) suggests lesion affecting left spinal cord? Actually contralateral spinothalamic after second order neuron cross within a few segments; so left spinothalamic loss would be from right side lesion of spinal cord. So left leg pain loss indicates right side spinal cord lesion. But motor weakness is right leg => left side corticospinal? That's inconsistent.\n\nLet's consider involvement of brainstem: e.g., lesion of left lateral medulla (Wallenberg) gives ipsilateral facial pain loss, contralateral body pain loss, but no motor weakness. Not matches.\n\nMaybe it's a lesion in the spinal cord affecting left corticospinal tract (which is crossed already) causing right leg weakness (since corticospinal decussates in medulla, so left side of spinal cord carries right side motor). Right leg weakness implies lesion of left corticospinal tract at spinal cord level (above lumbar). Dorsal column: left side dorsal column carries left leg proprioception; but we see right leg proprio loss (so lesion of right dorsal column). So lesion is both left corticospinal and right dorsal column -> suggests a lesion crossing midline? This could be due to a lesion in the spinal cord that is expanding centrally (e.g., tumor, demyelinating lesion) causing \"syringomyelia\"? Syrinx causes loss of pain/temp at level, but not motor or dorsal column.\n\nHmm maybe it's a lesion in the brain: right leg weakness indicates left motor cortex (paracentral lobule). Proprioception (vibration) loss in right leg also indicates left parietal involvement (since proprio pathway ascends contralaterally after crossing at medulla, so left cortex processes right leg proprio). Pain/temp loss in left leg indicates involvement of right spinothalamic pathway before crossing? Actually pain from left leg crosses to right side at spinal cord, ascends to thalamus, then projects to right cortex. So left leg pain loss indicates right thalamic or cortical lesion. So we have motor and proprio deficits on right side (left cortical) and pain loss on left side (right cortical). This suggests a lesion affecting both left and right hemispheres? Could be a lesion in the spinal cord with crossed findings.\n\nBut MRI shows abnormal enhancement in spinal cord? Need to view FLAIR image (not provided) but question mentions head MRI with enhancement. So lesion is in brain, not spinal.\n\nFindings: CSF protein slightly high 62 mg/dL, mild pleocytosis (1). ANCA negative. Age 28 female. Subacute onset (days). MRI FLAIR showing lesion maybe in periventricular region? With enhancement. The pattern could be multiple sclerosis (MS). In MS, we get optic neuritis (previous left eye blurred), sensory and motor deficits, lesions enhancing. MRI brain shows periventricular lesions, often with Dawson fingers. For diagnosis, additional test: oligoclonal bands in CSF. That is option e. So likely diagnosis is MS.\n\nThus the appropriate additional test is CSF oligoclonal bands.\n\nThus answer e.\n\nCheck other options: FDG-PET not typical. EEG not. Cerebral angiography not. DaT SPECT for Parkinson. So right.\n\nHence 62 answer: e.\n\n"

That's a \"alternating sensory loss\" suggestive of spinal cord lesion at level? Possibly multiple sclerosis? However signs: unilateral motor weakness (right leg), contralateral sensory deficits? Actually left leg temperature loss suggests spinothalamic involvement crossing? In spinal cord lesion left crossing? Right leg motor (corticospinal) = left side lesion? Wait corticospinal decussates in medulla, so right leg weakness suggests left corticospinal tract lesion. But left leg temperature loss suggests left spinothalamic (which ascends ipsilateral after crossing). Actually spinothalamic crosses within a few segments to contralateral side, so left leg temperature loss would be due to right side lesion. Contradiction.\n\nMaybe lesion is in brainstem? But motor deficits only lower limb. Could be neuromyelitis optica? Past transient left eye blurred vision (optic neuritis) 8 years ago. Now longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis? Sensory dissociation (pain/temp vs vibration) suggests spinal cord lesion crossing? Actually in myelitis you can have both. But the pattern of dissociated sensory loss (temperature loss on left leg, vibration loss on right leg) suggests lesion at spinal cord level affecting crossing fibers? Could be \"Lhermitte's sign\"? Not.\n\nAnother possibility is multiple sclerosis: optic neuritis (previous), motor weakness, sensory deficits. MRI not given but CSF shows mild protein elevation, mild pleocytosis, but oligoclonal bands not mentioned; but could be MS. ANCA negative.\n\nTreatment target for MS?

The question: \"呼吸障害に対し、鑑別診断を行うこととした。別に示す物品の写真（別冊No. 5①〜⑤）のうち、検体採取に用いるのはどれか。\" So for respiratory distress differential diagnosis, we need to collect a specimen. Likely we need to obtain a tracheal aspirate, or nasopharyngeal swab, or sputum, or gastric aspirate, or blood gas. In neonate with respiratory distress, we might suspect neonatal pneumonia, meconium aspiration, or RDS. We need to collect a \"肺胞肺胞洗浄液\"? No.\n\nIn neonatal respiratory distress differential, common tests: blood gas (already done), chest X-ray, blood cultures, urine cultures, CSF. For infection, need blood culture. But \"検体採取に用いるのはどれか\" with pictures of items likely includes: syringe, swab, capillary tube, blood collection tube, etc. Which is used for sample collection? Could be a sterile suction catheter for tracheal aspirate, or a cuffed endotracheal tube, or a disposable plastic bag for urine (cotton). What items may be in a neonatal setting? Items numbered maybe: ① - suction catheter, ② - arterial blood gas syringe, ③ - capillary blood collector (heel prick), ④ - nasopharyngeal aspirate ampoule, 5 - cotton swab.\n\nWe need to think of an item used to collect specimen for diagnosing respiratory causes. For neonatal respiratory distress, you might need to do a \"血液培養\" (blood culture) to rule out sepsis, which uses a blood culture bottle (a syringe). Or you may need \"気管支肺胞洗浄液\" which uses a sterile suction catheter.\n\nHowever the question says \"呼吸障害に対し、鑑別診断を行うこととした。\" Means they will do differential diagnosis for respiratory disorder. \"別に示す物品の写真（別冊No.5①〜⑤）のうち、検体採取に用いるのはどれか。\" Among the pictures, which is used for specimen collection?\n\nLikely answer is the \"採血管\" (blood collection tube). But which image corresponds to that? Without images, but typical exam includes items like: blood collection tube (with clot activator), sterile swab, urine collection bag, sputum cup, etc. The correct is probably \"①\" which might be a sterile suction tube.\n\nWe need more clues. The scenario shows blood gases indicating respiratory acidosis (pCO2 high). They may suspect neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. To differentiate, they might need to test for \"肺炎\" - need tracheal aspirate culture. The specimen collection tool would be a \"syringe with a catheter\" (endotracheal aspiration). Among typical images, a \"suction catheter\" is often used for airway suction.\n\nExam likely expects answer d or e etc.\n\nLet's consider what Japanese medical exam style: they often include pictures of items labeled ① to ⑤: maybe ① blood culture bottle, ② endotracheal tube, ③ nasopharyngeal swab, ④ arterial blood gas syringe, ⑤ urine collection bag. For respiratory differential, you would take a \"blood culture\", \"tracheal aspirate\", \"nasopharyngeal swab\" for viral PCR. Which one is used for specimen collection? All of them are, but maybe they ask which is used to collect \"血液培養\" - then would be bottle.\n\nBut phrase \"検体採取に用いるのはどれか\" singular. Might be \"specimen collection\" like \"肺胞洗浄液を採取する際に使用する\" which is \"suction catheter\" (②?).\n\nWe need to guess the answer key typical for this question. Could search memory: In Japanese textbooks, there is a series of pictures in \"別冊 No.5\" for clinical tests. Likely includes: ①ガーゼ, ②採血用採血管, ③培養用血液採取瓶, ④鼻腔拭い綿棒, ⑤痰の容器. Which one is for specimen collection? Actually most of them are for specimen collection. But maybe the point is: For respiratory differential you need \"気道吸引液\" (tracheal aspirate) which uses \"吸引カテーテル\". That is probably picture ③? Not sure.\n\nGiven uncertainty, maybe choose option a (①) as typical answer.\n\nLet's decide: Answer a."

Under the law, the local government (municipality) is the executing body? I think the implementation of routine vaccination is carried out by municipalities (市区町村) but the responsibility is of prefectural governments? Actually the law says that \"都道府県及び市町村は、予防接種の実施について協力しなければならない\" and the local municipality (市区町村) usually conducts vaccination. Implementation主体 is \"市町村\". So a is false.\n\nb: 子宮頸癌ワクチンは対象外である。 The cervical cancer vaccine (HPV) is not included in the routine vaccination schedule? Currently in Japan, as of 2026? As of 2024, HPV vaccine is now recommended and is part of routine vaccination? I think it was added to the routine vaccination schedule in 2013 but then withdrew recommendation, but later reinstated. Actually the routine vaccination schedule (定期接種) includes HPV vaccine for girls aged 12-16 (2 doses). So it is included. So statement b (HPV vaccine is not target) is false.\n\nc: 全ての定期接種の費用は全額公費で負担される。 Are all routine vaccination costs fully funded by public expense? In Japan, routine vaccinations are fully covered by the national/local government; there is no personal expense. Yes, the law provides that costs are borne by public funds. So c is true.\n\nd: MRワクチンは接種対象者に接種を受ける努力義務がある。 The law imposes a \"努力義務\" (duty to make effort) for parents to have children receive routine vaccinations, including MR (measles-rubella) vaccine. Yes, it is a \"努力義務\" (effort obligation). However, the statement says \"接種対象者に接種を受ける努力義務がある。\" It is correct that there is effort duty for the target person. So d also looks correct? Wait the law defines \"努力義務\" for parents (or guardians) to have children receive routine vaccinations. So indeed MR is part of routine schedule, thus there is an effort duty. The statement d says there is an effort duty for MR vaccine. That's correct.\n\nBut the question: \"予防接種法に規定されている定期接種で正しいのはどれか。\" Which single statement is correct? Possibly multiple? But they likely expect one correct answer. Need to see which is most accurate. Let's double-check c: All routine vaccination costs are fully publicly funded. Yes, the law states that \"国及び地方公共団体は、定期接種に要する費用の全額を負担しなければならない。\" So c is correct.\n\nd: The law includes \"努力義務\" for parents, not for the target individuals themselves (i.e., the child). It says \"保護者は、定期接種の対象者に対し、予防接種を受けさせるように努めなければならない。\" So it is an obligation on the parent, not the target person, but statement says \"接種対象者に接種を受ける努力義務がある。\" That's ambiguous: it could be interpreted that the target person (or their guardian) has a duty. The wording might be considered correct in essence? Usually the phrase is \"保護者に努力義務がある\" not \"接種対象者に\".

For lower extremities: each leg is 18% (front+back). But for perineum? Typically perineum/genitals 1% (adult). However she has burns from perineum and both lower limbs down to foot sole (i.e., entire lower limbs). So both legs total 36% plus perineum 1% = 37% TBSA. However perineum might be included in lower limbs? Let's consider the area: \"陰部, 両側下肢から足底にかけてⅢ度熱傷\". Means perineum and both lower limbs down to the soles.

Risk factors: dialysis, immunocompromised, splenectomy -> increased risk for encapsulated organisms, especially Staphylococcus aureus also common for vertebral osteomyelitis especially from dialysis catheters. But Gram stain would help: choices include Gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella, Pseudomonas), Gram-positive cocci (Neisseria (gram-negative diplococci), Staph aureus (Gram-positive cocci in clusters), Streptococcus agalactiae (group B strep) Gram-positive cocci in chains). Likely Staph aureus is most common cause of hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis in dialysis patients.\n\nThus answer d."

Actually left eyelid ptosis suggests left CN III palsy. Rightward gaze diplopia suggests left eye can't move laterally? Wait lateral rectus is innervated by VI, so maybe left VI palsy causing diplopia on right gaze (when eyes need to look right, left eye abducts). Ptosis suggests left III involvement. So multiple cranial nerve palsies (III, IV, VI) could be due to neuromuscular junction disorder like Myasthenia gravis. Edrophonium (Tensilon) test improves symptoms. That suggests Myasthenia gravis.

The question: \"頸部病変で正しいのはどれか。\" (Which statement about the neck lesion is correct?)\n\nOptions:\n\na) 病変部位が移動する。 (The lesion moves with swallowing?) Or \"lesion site moves\"? Might refer to submandibular gland? For thyroid nodule, it moves with swallowing. But statement \"病変部位が移動する\" maybe meaning the lesion moves when swallowing - yes thyroid moves upward with swallow. That is true for thyroid nodules. But they might be asking about node's characteristics: Does the lesion move? Usually thyroid nodule moves with swallowing due to its attachment to trachea.\n\nb) 頸部リンパ節転移を生じない。 (Does not cause cervical lymph node metastasis) - Benign nodular goiter does not metastasize, so true. But do they ask about \"頸部病変\" meaning the thyroid nodule? If it's a benign nodule, no metastasis.\n\nc) 高カルシウム血症を合併する。 (Accompanied by hypercalcemia) - No.\n\nd) 穿刺吸引細胞診が必要である。 (Fine-needle aspiration cytology is required) For nodular goiter, FNA indicated if suspicion of malignancy based on ultrasound features. The given ultrasound maybe shows a simple cystic? They said \"別冊No.11\" likely typical for nodular goiter (solid, isoechoic, spongiform), could be benign, but FNA may not be needed. But in general, evaluation of thyroid nodule >1 cm often includes FNA unless clearly benign. The case is 35yo, euthyroid, no risk factors, ultrasound maybe shows a \"spongiform\" nodule, which is considered benign and FNA not required. So maybe answer is b or a.\n\nOption e) A群β溶連菌感染が原因となる。 (Group A Streptococcus infection is cause) That's for acute suppurative thyroiditis maybe? No.\n\nWe need choose the correct statement about the neck lesion (thyroid nodule). Let's examine each.\n\na) 病変部位が移動する: Typically thyroid nodule moves on swallowing because thyroid is attached to trachea. So this is true. However, the phrasing \"病変部位が移動する\" could be ambiguous: Does the lesion shift location? Usually thyroid gland moves upward, not the lesion location moving relative to skin. But exam often asks: \"甲状腺は嚥下に伴い前方に移動する\" – correct. So a could be correct.\n\nb) It does not cause cervical lymph node metastasis. Benign nodular goiter: no metastasis. So also true.\n\nBut they likely are looking for a single correct answer. Which one is more specific? Maybe the question context: \"頸部病変で正しいのはどれか。\" given options that test features of thyroid cancer vs benign disease. For a benign nodule, true statements: a (moves with swallowing) is characteristic of thyroid origin. b (no lymph node metastasis) also true but it's general. However, if they ask \"頸部病変\" maybe referring to \"頸部リンパ節転移\" as a feature of carcinoma. So b is more about carcinoma: if it's carcinoma, it may metastasize. Since this is benign, they say \"does not cause\". That is true but perhaps less characteristic.\n\nNevertheless typical exam answer: \"頸部リンパ節転移を生じない\" is a feature of benign goiter. \"A群β溶連菌感染が原因となる\" refers to acute infectious thyroiditis (rare). So I'd choose b as the best.\n\nCheck for nuance: In endemic areas, papillary carcinoma can have neck lymph node mets. So note that benign nodule doesn't.\n\nFNA necessity: guidelines say nodules >1 cm with suspicious US require FNA; benign features not. So maybe not required. So d is false.\n\nThus answer b.\n\nLet's output."

The MRI diffusion and MRA presumably show left MCA M1 occlusion. Patient NIHSS 16 moderate severe. He has contraindications? He had recent surgery (gastric ulcer perforation surgery) 5 days ago. That's a relative contraindication for tPA due to recent major surgery (<14 days). Also risk of bleeding. Mechanical thrombectomy might be considered even with recent surgery? Usually anticoagulation after recent surgery is relative, but thrombectomy is endovascular, not systemic thrombolysis. Guidelines: Major surgery within 14 days is a contraindication for IV tPA. So tPA is contraindicated. Mechanical thrombectomy can be done up to 24h with selected patients, even with recent surgery? The risk of hemorrhage maybe less than tPA; guidelines allow thrombectomy if no contraindication to endovascular procedures. So answer likely c.

      "reasoning": "We need to interpret question. 54-year-old male with systolic murmur at left sternal edge 4th intercostal spaces, grade 4/6, with an S4? Actually says \"IV音\". IV = fourth heart sound (presumably S4). So likely aortic stenosis? Systolic murmur at left sternal border could be aortic stenosis (radiates to carotids) or pulmonic flow murmur, but given older patient, likely aortic stenosis. S4 indicates left ventricular hypertrophy due to stiff ventricle as in aortic stenosis. The echo images would confirm aortic stenosis.\n\nQuestion: \"この患者の心雑音増強因子で誤っているのはどれか。\" That is: Which of the following is NOT a factor that augments the murmur in this patient?\n\nOptions: a) frequent pulse? Actually \"頻 脈\" meaning \"tachycardia\"? Frequent pulse (increased heart rate). b) standing position. c) nitroglycerin administration. d) Valsalva maneuver. e) disopyramide administration.\n\nWe need to know which maneuver increases murmur of aortic stenosis. For aortic stenosis, murmur intensity increases with increased afterload (e.g., handgrip, squatting). It decreases with decreased preload (e.g., standing, Valsalva strain phase). It also decreases with decreased afterload (nitroglycerin). Tachycardia can increase murmur intensity (by decreasing diastole, maybe more flow). Disopyramide is a class IA antiarrhythmic with negative inotropic effect (decreases contractility) and can increase afterload? Not sure.\n\nLet's recall: In aortic stenosis murmur: Increases with squatting (increase preload and afterload), handgrip (increase afterload). Decreases with Valsalva (phase II) (decrease preload). Standing (from supine) also decreases preload, reduces murmur.\n\nThus for aortic stenosis, the augmenting factors are: increased afterload (handgrip), increased contractility (beta agonists, low afterload? Actually increase flow), increased heart rate? Up to a point may increase intensity. But the classic teaching: In aortic stenosis, the murmur gets louder with squatting, handgrip, and decreased with Valsalva, standing.\n\nThus the items:\n\na) Tachycardia (頻 脈). Not sure if that augments murmur. It may increase flow, but the intensity may actually decrease because shorter ejection time. Usually for aortic stenosis, increased heart rate may increase murmur intensity because of increased flow, but also reduces preload due to less diastolic filling. I think murmurs of aortic stenosis are increased with increased contractility (e.g., dobutamine). Tachycardia could increase. Not a classic exam point.\n\nb) Standing decreases preload thus decreases murmur, so standing is NOT an augment factor; it's a diminishing factor. So the answer likely b.\n\nc) Nitroglycerin (vasodilator) reduces afterload (and preload). That would decrease murmur. So not augment.\n\nd) Valsalva decreases preload, reduces murmur. Not augment.\n\ne) Disopyramide is a negative inotropic agent; reduces contractility, reduces murmur. Not augment.\n\nThus many options are not augmentors. But question asks which is incorrectly listed as a murmur augmentor. So only one of them is actually a true augmentor, the rest are false? Let's consider each focusing on aortic stenosis.\n\nClassic factors that increase murmur intensity in aortic stenosis: increased contractility (e.g., afterload), increased preload, increased afterload (handgrip), increased heart rate? Not typical.\n\nFrom resources: For aortic stenosis, maneuvers: murmur intensity increases with squatting (↑ venous return, ↑ afterload), handgrip (↑ afterload), and decreases with Valsalva (Phase II) (↓ preload), standing (↓ preload). Also decreases with nitroglycerin.\n\nThus among options, only \"手握\" (handgrip) would be true augmentor but not listed. So which one is incorrectly considered augment? All given? Wait maybe the answer is 'a' (tachycardia) because tachycardia does NOT augment; they think it's incorrect. But standing also does not augment. However maybe the question is about \"心雑音増強因子\" meaning factors that increase the intensity of this particular murmur (AS). They list five options; we need the one that is wrong (i.e., not a factor that increases). Likely there is only one that is actually not an augmentor; the rest are augmentors. Let's see each:\n\n- Tachycardia (increased heart rate) can increase murmur in most systolic murmurs because flow increases; but for AS, higher HR reduces diastolic filling, maybe reduces intensity. Not sure a standard teaching. I think high HR may increase murmur in AS due to increased flow across the valve.\n\n- Standing reduces preload, makes murmur softer; so not augment.\n\n- Nitroglycerin reduces preload/afterload, makes murmur softer; not augment.\n\n- Valsalva reduces preload, softer; not augment.\n\n- Disopyramide reduces contractility, softer; not augment.\n\nThus only tachycardia could be augment. So the incorrect statement (i.e., not a true augmentor) could be any of b-e. But they ask \"誤っているのはどれか\" singular. Which one is incorrectly listed as increasing a murmur? Could be that they intended that all other four are true augmentors, but only one is false. Let's verify each: Does nitroglycerin actually increase AS murmur? I think nitroglycerin reduces preload dramatically; AS murmur intensity decreases. So that's false. However some source says nitrates reduce afterload and may increase gradient across valve? But likely decreased.\n\nWhat about disopyramide? It's negative inotropic; reduces contractility, thus less force could reduce murmur intensity. So false.\n\nValsalva: decreases. False.\n\nStanding: decreases. False.\n\nThus only tachycardia is true. So four are false. But question expects one answer. Maybe the patient actually has hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) rather than AS. Let's reconsider.\n\nSystolic murmur at left sternal border, grade 4/6, with S4, plus echo images likely show asymmetric septal hypertrophy and outflow obstruction. In HOCM, murmur is a systolic ejection murmur that increases with standing (decreased preload) and Valsalva (decreased preload), and decreases with squatting, handgrip, nitroglycerin? Actually for HOCM, murmur intensity increases with decreased preload (standing, Valsalva) and with increased contractility (e.g., exercise). It decreases with handgrip (increases afterload) and with nitroglycerin (decreases preload). So the augmentors for HOCM are: standing, Valsalva, tachycardia, etc. Disopyramide is used as treatment, decreases obstruction (thus decreases murmur). So that would be a decreasing factor, not augment.\n\nThus given the question \"心雑音増強因子\" for this patient, which factor is erroneously listed? Let's see: For HOCM, augmentors: standing (yes), Valsalva (yes), nitroglycerin (no; nitro decreases LVOT obstruction by reducing preload? Actually nitro reduces preload, increasing obstruction? In HOCM, decreasing preload worsens obstruction, so nitro would increase murmur. Indeed, in HOCM, nitroglycerin can exacerbate obstruction, so murmur intensity increases. So nitro is an augmentor for HOCM. Disopyramide reduces obstruction, so murmur decreases (so not augment). Tachycardia (increased contractility) also increases murmur.\n\nThus for HOCM, the only incorrect augmentor is disopyramide (e). So answer would be e.\n\nNeed to decide which diagnosis fits better: The murmur location left sternal border 4th intercostal; not radiating to carotids; there is S4. In HOCM, there may be S4 due to stiff ventricle. The echo would show asymmetric septal hypertrophy. The question includes echo images - likely show hypertrophy. So diagnosis is HOCM.\n\nThus answer is e) ジソピラミド投与 (disopyramide) which would actually reduce murmur, not increase. So that's the incorrect factor.\n\nThus final answer: 【回答】e"

TPO antibody positive => Hashimoto thyroiditis. Ultrasound: enlarged uterus (uterine size increased), ovarian diffuse high echogenicity mass 7 cm (probably ovarian carcinoma? But maybe luteinized ovarian cyst? Could be ovarian fibroma? In hypothyroid, there is possibility of hyperstimulation? However 7cm mass could be ovarian tumor like granulosa cell tumor (estrogen producing) causing endometrial hyperplasia. However TSH high etc. The question: \"内分泌異常に対する治療で改善が期待できるのはどれか。\" Means which abnormality can be improved by treating the endocrine abnormality (i.e., hypothyroidism). Which of the listed features would improve if we treat hypothyroidism? Hypothyroidism can cause menorrhagia, menstrual irregularities, infertility due to anovulation, and also cause uterine enlargement? Possibly cause menstrual cycle irregularities due to impaired GnRH pulsatility leading to anovulation => irregular cycles and dysmenorrhea maybe. Also hypothyroidism can cause elevated prolactin due to TRH stimulation but prolactin is normal. Also can cause the so-called \"hypothyroid-associated ovarian cysts\" (multicystic enlarged ovaries). There's a condition: \"hypothyroidism-associated ovarian cysts\" known as \"multicystic ovaries\" that can regress with thyroxine therapy. Also can cause \"hydrosalpinx\"? Not typical. The uterine size may increase from estrogen excess (if ovarian tumor) not due to hypothyroid. The ovarian mass 7 cm maybe a \"theca lutein cyst\" due to high hCG? Not.\n\nBut focusing: Which of these would improve after correcting hypothyroidism? Options: a menstrual pain, b uterine enlargement, c ovarian tumor, d hydrosalpinx (tubal dilation with fluid), e menstrual cycle irregularity. Among these, hypothyroidism can cause menstrual irregularity (oligomenorrhea, menorrhagia) and dysmenorrhea maybe. So improvement expected for menstrual cycle irregularity (e). Menstrual pain may improve as part of that? But more directly the cycle irregularity is due to endocrine abnormality.\n\nThus answer likely e.\n\nLet's verify: Treat hypothyroidism with levothyroxine will normalize TSH, improve ovulation, regularize cycle, improve infertility. Uterine size enlarge due to estrogen? Not likely to shrink quickly. Ovarian mass may be due to hypothyroidism-related cystic changes that shrink after therapy. But a 7 cm mass likely not just cyst. But there is \"ovarian hyperstimulation due to hypothyroidism (OH)\" - not common. But mass may be a cyst that could resolve. The question expects which is expected to improve. In textbooks, hypothyroidism can cause \"multicystic ovaries\" that regress with thyroxine. Also can cause \"menorrhagia and anovulatory cycles\". Among the answer choices, both c and e could be improved. Which is more likely? Let's think of typical board exam: In hypothyroidism, ovary can have multiple cysts (so-called \"hypothyroidism-related ovarian cyst\"). So therapy resolves cyst. Therefore ovarian cyst might improve - that is c. However they described \"びまん性高輝度エコー像を呈する径7 cmの腫瘤\" (diffuse high echogenic mass 7 cm). That's not typical simple cyst. Could be a \"granulosa cell tumor\"? That's estrogen-producing causing endometrial hyperplasia -> uterine enlargement; but not due to hypothyroidism. So perhaps that mass is a \"thyroid adenoma\"? No. So it likely is a tumor not responsive to thyroid therapy.\n\nThus answer e (menstrual cycle irregularities) is more solid.\n\nHydrosalpinx due to tubal blockage from inflammation does not improve with thyroid.\n\nThus answer e."

      "reasoning": "We need to answer which symptom is present in Kawasaki disease but not in scarlet fever (猩紅熱). Options: a)皮疹 (skin rash), b)イチゴ舌 (strawberry tongue), c)膜様落屑 (membranous desquamation), d)頸部リンパ節腫大 (cervical lymphadenopathy), e)両側眼球結膜充血 (bilateral conjunctival injection).\n\nKawasaki disease features: high fever, conjunctival injection (bilateral non-exudative), oral changes (strawberry tongue, red cracked lips), extremity changes (edema, erythema, later desquamation especially periungual), cervical lymphadenopathy (often unilateral >1.5 cm), polymorphous rash. Scarlet fever includes a sandpaper rash, strawberry tongue can appear? Actually scarlet fever can have \"strawberry tongue\" as well (the tongue is red with papillae, \"strawberry\" appearance). It also has conjunctival injection? Usually not. So which is present in Kawasaki but not in scarlet fever? Conjunctival injection (bilateral) is typical for Kawasaki, not typical for scarlet fever. Membranous desquamation (peeling) is characteristic for Kawasaki, not scarlet fever. Scarlet fever may have desquamation (sheeting) after rash? I recall scarlet fever can have desquamation of skin (peeling) after rash, especially on fingertips, similar to Kawasaki? Actually scarlet fever can have desquamation as the rash subsides (shedding skin), called \"peeling\". But it occurs more on fingertips. The membranous desquamation (like in Kawasaki) maybe also seen? Not typical. Cervical lymphadenopathy can be in both. Rash present in both. Strawberry tongue can be in both. So likely answer is c) 膜様落屑 (membranous desquamation). That is more specific to Kawasaki.\n\nCheck: \"Kawasaki disease\" diagnosing criteria: fever >5 days + 4 of 5: bilateral conjunctival injection, oral mucosal changes (strawberry tongue, erythema), peripheral extremity changes (edema, erythema, desquamation), polymorphous rash, cervical lymphadenopathy. Scarlet fever: rash (fine papular, sandpaper), strawberry tongue, strawberry tongue also, but conjunctival injection not typical, desquamation not typical? Actually scarlet fever can have \"peeling of skin on the fingertips and toes\" after rash. But the question asks \"感認, which symptom is seen in Kawasaki disease but not in scarlet fever?\" Among options, best answer is c) 膜様落屑 (membranous desquamation). So answer a? No, both have rash. b both. d both can have cervical lymphadenopathy though scarlet fever less common? But still can. e bilateral conjunctival injection is not in scarlet fever. So e also qualifies. Which is more specific? Typical is conjunctival injection is not present in scarlet fever. However some textbooks mention that scarlet fever can have conjunctival injection? Usually not. So both c and e might be correct. But exam likely expects e (bilateral conjunctival injection). Let's think: \"膜様落屑\" - That's characteristic of Kawasaki (in subacute phase). Scarlet fever might also have desquamation but not membranous? The phrase \"膜様落屑\" (membranous desquamation) maybe refers to the periungual peeling, typical of Kawasaki. So answer c. I'd choose c."

Which cranial nerve likely affected? This suggests loss of ability to close eyelids? Actually \"まぶしく感じ、目を開けているのがつらい\" = \"feels glaring even at normal brightness, keeping the eyes open is painful\". Could be due to loss of ability to constrict pupil (pupillary reflex) causing photophobia. The cranial nerve controlling pupillary constriction is parasympathetic via oculomotor nerve (III). So likely oculomotor nerve palsy causing impaired pupillary constriction leading to photophobia.\n\nBut also could be due to lid closure dysfunction (Bell's palsy facial nerve) causing inability to close eye leading to corneal dryness and discomfort but that is \"can't close eyes\" not glare. Photophobia is due to lack of accommodation? Pupillary response?\n\nLet's think: Photophobia (light sensitivity) arises from issues with the parasympathetic innervation of sphincter pupillae (III) or maybe due to optic nerve (II) lesions causing poor vision and light sensitivity? Typically optic neuritis cause pain with eye movement and visual loss.\n\nBut the phrase \"普通の明るさでもまぶしく感じ、目を開けているのがつらい\" indicates \"even normal light feels bright, keeping the eyes open is painful\".

They ask \"When removing the sutures (抜糸), where should you cut with scissors?\" The options correspond to numbered locations ①-⑤ in the figure.\n\nWe need to know the proper place to cut the suture when removing: Usually you cut the knot at the outermost point away from the wound, i.e., the loop where the suture emerges from tissue (the external knot), not near the tissue. In a simple suturing, you cut the suture about 2-3mm from the knot, on the side away from the wound, to avoid tissue damage. If the figure shows labels, typical answer: cut at the knot (①?)

In many textbooks, the proper cut site is at the point where the suture exits the skin, i.e., the loop on the skin surface (the knot) before the suture enters tissue – you cut the suture on the side opposite the wound, near the knot.\n\nLet’s imagine the figure: Perhaps it shows a cross-section with the suture crossing the tissue. There may be labels: ①: external knot, ②: subcutaneous portion, ③: inside wound, ④: other side knot, ⑤: maybe something else. The correct place to cut with scissors is at the knot on the skin side (external knot) - i.e., cut the suture distal to the knot, not through the knot.

Actually there was \"医師の労働時間等の適正化に関する指針\" etc. Resident doctors have limits: 8 hours per day, 40 hours per week? In Japan, the law originally didn't apply to doctors because of \"医師特例\". But recent reforms (2020) introduced \"医師の労働時間等の上限規制\" for certain hospitals (≥200 beds). The law says resident physicians are subject to working hour limits (24h work is allowed but limit on total).

In Japan, brain death (legal) is diagnosed based on: (1) irreversible coma, (2) absence of brainstem reflexes, (3) apnea test showing no spontaneous respiration, and (4) confirmatory tests may be used but not required? Actually Japanese law requires two physicians to confirm. The criteria include:\n\n- Deep coma (unresponsive) with no brain activity.\n- Absence of brainstem reflexes: pupillary light reflex, corneal reflex, oculocephalic reflex, oculovestibular reflex, gag reflex, cough reflex.\n- Apnea test: absence of spontaneous breathing when CO2 rises.\n- No confounding factors (e.g., hypothermia, drugs, metabolic disturbances).\n\nEEG flat is not part of legal criteria, but may be used as ancillary test, but not required. However the question asks which of the underlined items (①~⑤) is not included in the legal brain death criteria. Let's map:\n\n① JCS III-300 indicates severe coma (unresponsive). That is part of the criteria (deep coma). So included.\n\n② No spontaneous breathing (self breathing). Apnea test requires absence of spontaneous breathing; needed for brain death. So included.\n\n③ Fixed dilated pupils (absence of brainstem reflex). That's part of brainstem reflexes, included.\n\n④ Patellar reflex absent. That's a spinal reflex, not brainstem; not part of criteria. The criteria focus on brainstem reflexes, not spinal reflexes. So patellar reflex is not included. So answer d.\n\n⑤ Flat EEG.

So reassuring fetal status.\n\nQuestion: At 5pm (i.e., 10 hours after admission) what is appropriate management? We must infer from partogram: maybe labor is not progressing (prolonged latent phase) or active phase dystocia? Not having the figure is a challenge. But typical board question: In primigravida at 40+ weeks, active phase starts at 4 cm? The latent phase may be prolonged if >20 hours for primip. At 5pm, maybe the cervix is 2 cm, no dilation change for several hours, indicating prolonged latent phase; management is expectant (observation) as it's a false labor? But she had regular pain and membranes intact, but maybe not adequate progress. So answer likely \"b 経過観察\" (observation). Let's think about other options: Artificial rupture of membranes (ARM) may be indicated if latent phase prolonged, but only if membranes are ruptured? Actually ROM can be done to augment labor. However BTB paper negative means membranes intact. At 5pm maybe they have been in latent phase >12h, we could do artificial rupture to augment. But guidelines: For primigravida, latent phase >20h = diagnosis of prolonged latent phase; management is observation (no active interventions) unless there are complications. So observation.\n\nIf there is no cervical change for 2 hours after active phase starts (i.e., after 4 cm), we consider active phase arrest; management is oxytocin augmentation. But we don't know dilation.\n\nGiven the data: She had regular 10 min contractions, but we don't know dilation. The partogram likely shows cervical dilation rate slower than alert line; maybe they are below the alert line for several hours -> indicates protracted active phase, need augmentation with oxytocin, not listed among options (子宮収縮薬投与). That is option e. Maybe correct answer is e.\n\nLet's reconstruct: In partogram, alert line starts at 0.5 cm/h for primigravida? Actually the linear partogram: latent phase up to 3 cm; active phase from 4 cm, expect 1 cm/h for nullip. If progress slower than 1 cm/h, after 2 hours deviation -> alert line, after 4h deviation -> action line. At 5pm, maybe they are beyond action line, indicating need for C-section (d). But fetal status is reassuring, so augmentation first.\n\nGiven options: a suction delivery (for fetal distress) no; b observation; c artificial rupture; d emergency C-section; e oxytocin.\n\nMost appropriate likely e (oxytocin augmentation) if active phase arrest. But is that given? The scenario: At 5am labor started, at 7am she arrives. At 5pm (10 hours later) there is still labor? We need to know dilation. The case includes partogram figure which likely shows slow progress: cervical dilation maybe 3 cm after 10h, still in latent. Management: diagnosis of prolonged latent phase. In that case, management is \"observe\" not oxytocin. However, to \"prolonged latent phase\" sometimes we can do amniotomy (artificial rupture) to augment. Option c. But guidelines say for prolonged latent, propose expectant management unless maternal/fetal complications. So observation.\n\nThus answer likely b.\n\nI'll choose b."

Options: a oxygen mask, b oral airway insertion, c endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation, d non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), e emergency cricothyrotomy (actually \"緊急気管切開\" - emergency tracheostomy) with mechanical ventilation.\n\nKey: Patient has no spontaneous breathing (apnea) but circulation is okay.

It's Japanese. \"10　国勢調査で把握されるのはどれか。\" Means \"Which of the following is captured in the census?\" The options: a 婚姻 (marriage), b 死産 (stillbirth), c 死亡 (death), d 出生 (birth), e 人口 (population). National census typically counts population and households, demographic data like age, sex, occupation. In Japan, the national census (国勢調査) is a survey that records population, households, and basic information. It does not count births or deaths directly? Actually census is conducted every 5 years (or 10?). The census records population as of the Census Day, includes births, deaths, etc indirectly. But which of these items are \"把握される\" (captured) by the census? Probably population (人口) is definitely captured. Others like marriage, stillbirth, death, birth may not be directly captured; those are recorded by vital statistics (e.g., marriage registration, birth/death registration). Census may not ask about births or deaths within the family? It may ask about sex, age, relationship, etc. It might not ask about marriage status? Actually census may ask about marital status (婚姻). I recall Japanese census includes \"婚姻状況\" (marital status) and \"世帯構成\". But not sure. Let's think: The options likely one correct answer. Among them, which is definitely included? Population (人口) is the core. So answer e. Probably that's correct. Let's answer.\n\n"

Let's think of skin signs that suggest internal malignancy: Acanthosis nigricans, Leser-Trélat sign (multiple seborrheic keratoses), etc. None of the options match.\n\nHowever \"弾性線維性仮性黄色腫\" is \"elastic fiber pseudoxanthoma\", which could be \"pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE)\".

Among listed, \"黒色表皮腫\" (black epidermal tumor) is a cutaneous metastasis? Could be \"悪性黒色表皮腫\" which can be a cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy (i.e., malignant melanoma of the skin can be primary, but some pigmented lesions like pigmented basal cell carcinoma etc).

Actually Merkel cell carcinoma is a neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin, also called \"Merkel cell tumor\", not black.\n\nBut there is a term \"黒色表皮腫\" translates to \"black epidermoid carcinoma\" maybe referring to \"sebaceous carcinoma\"? Not.\n\nNevertheless, the likely answer amongst these is \"黒色表皮腫\".\n\nThus pick b."

Options: a) 結核 (tuberculosis) (the kanji \"結　核\"? maybe misprinted). b) A型肝炎. c) エボラ出血熱 (Ebola hemorrhagic fever). d) 腸管出血性大腸菌感染症 (Enterohaemorrhagic E.coli infection). e) 新型コロナウイルス感染症 (COVID-19).\n\nNeed to know which is not included in \"全数把握\" (i.e., not \"all case\" reporting). In Japanese infectious disease surveillance, there are categories: \"指定感染症\" with categories: Category 1 (all case reporting), Category 2 (sentinel?). Actually, the \"感染症発生動向調査\" (Infectious Disease Surveillance) includes categories: \"全数把握対象\" (i.e., all-case reporting) of certain diseases like measles, rubella, pertussis, TB? The \"National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases\" (NESID) monitors about 50 diseases.

Actually TB is a notifiable disease, but there is TB surveillance system, but maybe it is not part of \"感染症発生動向調査\". In Japan TB is a \"感染症法\" designated as Category 5? I'm not certain.\n\nA型肝炎 is a designated infectious disease under \"全数把握\"? I think A hepatitis is notifiable and \"全数把握\" maybe not; Actually Infectious disease surveillance for hepatitis A is \"all case\" (I think yes). Ebola hemorrhagic fever is obviously a Category 1 disease subject to all case. Same for COVID-19. Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli infection? There's \"腸管出血性大腸菌感染症\" (EHEC) is also a designated disease (Category 2?) Might be all-case also.\n\nThus maybe the correct answer: a) 結核 (TB) is not included in the \"感染症発生動向調査\"?\n\nLet's verify: The Infectious Disease Surveillance includes: Influenza sentinel, RSV sentinel, bacterial meningitis sentinel, etc. \"全数把握対象\" includes: Measles, Rubella, Pertussis, Diphtheria, Tetanus?

The phrase \"患者自身に行わない\" maybe means the team does it, not the patient. So which is not done by the patient themselves? Let's think: Grief care is provided by team; patient cannot self-provide.

In Japan's \"配偶者からの暴力の防止及び被害者の保護等に関する法律\" (the Act on the Prevention of Spousal Violence etc). I recall that medical institutions are required to report to the \"警察官\" (police) or \"地方公共団体の保健所長\"? Let's think: The law defines \"通報\" duty: \"医療機関等は、被害の疑いがある場合には、警察官又は地方公共団体の福祉事務所長に通報しなければならない\" Something like that. Actually I think the law says that \"医師、歯科医師、薬剤師、助産師、看護師等の医療従事者は、配偶者からの暴力の疑いがある被害者を発見した場合、警察官または地方公共団体の福祉事務所長に通報しなければならない。\" Let's verify: The DV law (Act No. 31 of 2001) includes article 21? There is an obligation for \"医師・看護師等は、配偶者からの暴力の疑いがある者を知った場合、警察官又は福祉事務所長に通報しなければならない\". So answer: a police officer OR c? c is family court; not correct. b health center; no. d welfare office = 福祉事務所. So correct answer is d (福祉事務所). However they ask \"通報できるのはどれか\" maybe both a and d possible? The question may allow multiple? Usually a single best answer. The law says either police or welfare office; both possible. Which one is listed? Both a and d are listed. Which is the correct answer? Usually exam expects \"警察官\" as answer for \"通報義務\" for physicians. But I recall that physicians must \"通報する\" to police, not to welfare office. Let's check memory: The \"DV防止法\" article 22? Actually regarding \"医療機関等が配偶者からの暴力の疑いがある者（被害者）を発見したときは、警察官又は地方公共団体の福祉事務所長に対し、速やかに通報しなければならない。\" So both are permissible. In multiple choice single answer, they might choose \"警察官\" because it's more general. But the wording \"通報できるのはどれか\" not \"通報しなければならない\". Could be \"通報できる\" meaning \"allowed to report to\". Both a and d are allowed. But only one choice is correct; maybe the question intends the correct authority is \"警察官\". Let's search memory: In previous exam Q, answer was \"警察官\". Also there is a separate provision for \"福祉事務所長\" for \"配偶者からの暴力の被害者が求めた場合等\". Not sure.\n\nLet's decide: answer a."

      "reasoning": "We need to pick the inappropriate method for a 4-month infant health check. Let's analyze each:\n\na: For weight measurement, removing clothes is standard to get accurate weight. Reasonable.\n\nb: For hip examination (screening for DDH), you need to remove diaper for Ortolani/Barlow maneuvers. So remove diaper, not necessarily whole clothes. So appropriate.\n\nc: For listening to heart/lungs, crying can affect auscultation. Usually you try to calm infant, may hold while caregiver holds. It says \"crying, so hold while parent holds and auscultate\". That seems appropriate: you may hold the infant on caregiver's lap to calm, then listen. I think appropriate.\n\nd: For oral cavity observation, using a tongue depressor at the beginning of examination. For infants, you wouldn't use a tongue depressor at beginning, you may observe without; using one may cause distress and risk gagging. Usually you examine oral cavity after the infant is calm, perhaps after other exam. Using tongue depressor at start seems not appropriate. But is it \"inappropriate\"? Actually for 4-month-old, you can gently open mouth with a tongue blade; not necessarily at very beginning; the phrasing \"診察の冒頭で舌圧子を用いる\" - using tongue depressor at the start of the exam may stimulate crying, making rest of exam difficult. So likely that's the \"not appropriate\".\n\ne: For checking chest elevation, you need the infant supine, not prone. Placing on abdomen (prone) on examination table for chest movement seems odd; chest elevation is seen when infant is supine or sitting? Typically you observe chest movement while lying supine. So putting the infant in prone (腹臥位) on the table to check chest rise is not appropriate. Actually \"胸の挙上の確認\" is to see respiratory movement; you could observe while baby is supine on the table, not prone. So e is likely inappropriate.\n\nWhich is more obviously wrong? Let's think each.\n\na: correct.\n\nb: correct.\n\nc: When infant cries, you may hold them to reduce movement. Auscultation while crying is difficult, but you can hold while parent holds. This is acceptable.\n\nd: Using a tongue depressor at the start of the exam may be not appropriate because you should first allow infant to settle; but you can examine oral cavity anytime; but using tongue depressor may cause gagging. However it's not necessarily prohibited.\n\ne: For chest elevation, you need to see thoracic movement; placing infant prone (腹臥位) would hinder chest expansion and also you cannot see chest movement because it's on the table? Actually you can see chest wall rising even when prone, but infants' breathing is normally observed in supine. However chest rise can be observed in any position. But \"診察台の上に腹臥位にする\" seems odd because infants cannot be placed prone for chest observation; it's more for back exam. So e might be the answer.\n\nWhich one among d and e is more clearly \"診察方法で適切でない\"? Consider typical health check at 4 month: measurement of weight, length, head circumference; check hips, eyes, ears, mouth, heart/lungs, abdomen, spine, neurological. For oral cavity, you usually use a tongue depressor after the infant is calm, not at beginning. But \"診察の冒頭で舌圧子を用いる\" might be considered inappropriate because it will cause crying and hinder other exams. So likely the answer is d.\n\nI think d is the best answer.\n\nThus output 【回答】d"

Soft, not crossing suture = cephalohematoma. That's common, not abnormal? It's a birth injury but typically resolves. It's a subperiosteal hemorrhage, limited by sutures. That's not abnormal? It's a typical finding postpartum. Consider maybe normal variant? It's considered a pathology but could be within normal birth trauma. But question asks which of the underlined parts is abnormal. We have list a-e.\n\n② Fontanelle (大泉門) is 3cm x 3cm, open, flat. Normal anterior fontanel size: approx 2-3 cm (range 0.5-3.0 cm) within that. 3x3 cm seems large but within upper limit. Flat is normal. So perhaps not abnormal.\n\n③ Conjunctival mild jaundice (yellowing). At 36 days old, mild jaundice could be physiologic jaundice of newborn peaks at ~5-7 days, resolves by 2 weeks. At 36 days, jaundice is abnormal (it should be resolved). However mild conjunctival jaundice may be from breast milk jaundice persisting up to 2 months. Could be within normal? But usually physiologic resolves by 2 weeks; persistent after 3 weeks may be pathologic. So likely abnormal.\n\n④ Indrawing respiration (陥没呼吸) i.e., retractions. That indicates respiratory distress. At 36 days, should not have retractions. So abnormal.\n\n⑤ Genital bleeding. Neonatal vaginal bleeding (due to withdrawal of maternal hormones) can occur in first few days, not at 36 days. So abnormal.\n\nWhich one is the abnormal? The question says \"下線部のうち、異常な所見はどれか。\" Means among the underlined parts, which is abnormal? The answer choices correspond to each numbered item. So multiple could be abnormal. Choose the one that is abnormal. Which one is considered abnormal? Possibly more than one, but they ask singular. Must pick the one that is pathologic. Let's think: At 36 days old, a soft swelling at left parietal region limited by suture (cephalohematoma) likely would have resolved by then? Cephalohematoma can take weeks to months to resolve; at 1 month may still be present, but it's a usual birth injury, not abnormal per se. The other findings: Fontanelle size 3x3 (maybe a bit large but within normal). Mild conjunctival jaundice at 36 days could be physiologic? Typically physiologic, highest at day 5, usually resolves by day 14. At day 36, still mild maybe due to breast milk jaundice - that can cause prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia up to 2 months. That can cause mild jaundice, but still considered not abnormal? The question likely expects that mild conjunctival yellowing is physiologic/jaundice of newborn, but at day 36 maybe borderline. However typical board question: Newborn with mild jaundice of conjunctiva only (no skin) is normal physiologic. At 36 days they'd say it's not normal. Not sure.\n\nIndrawing respirations: that's abnormal respiratory distress.\n\nGenital bleeding at 36 days is abnormal.\n\nWhich one is most clearly abnormal: Indrawing respiration (④) - indicates respiratory distress, may need evaluation. So answer likely d.\n\nThus answer d."

Betamethasone (c) for fetal lung maturity if risk of preterm delivery <34 weeks. At 30 weeks, polyhydramnios increases risk of preterm labor, but before giving steroids, we need to assess if preterm labor is imminent? The CTG may show fetal distress? No description. Probably there are frequent uterine contractions? The question might be about \"uterine activity\" and \"fetal heart rate tracing\" - maybe indicates early decelerations due to cord compression due to polyhydramnios? The first step may be to give betamethasone for lung maturity if preterm birth likely. However guidelines: At 30 weeks, if risk of preterm delivery within 7 days, give betamethasone. Polyhydramnios itself isn't enough to give steroids unless signs of preterm labor. So maybe first step is to measure cervical length to assess risk. Option b.\n\nAlso 75 g OGTT (e) would be for gestational diabetes but already had 50 g test at 24 weeks borderline but normal (125). Usually if abnormal >140, then 75 g test.

After 3 hours in hospital, cervical dilation 7 cm, effacement 80%, fetal head descent SP+2 cm (i.e., +2). So active labor progressing well. \"小泉門が先進し、12時方向に触れる。\" Probably \"小泉門\" = \"mediolateral\"? Actually \"小泉門\" maybe \"Os of the uterine circulatory\"? Not sure; might refer to \"the posterior intermembrane\"? But likely means \"the fetal occiput is at 12 o'clock direction\" (i.e., occiput anterior?). The fetal head position: 12 o'clock means occiput anterior (OP). So good position.\n\nNow fetal heart rate tracing is given but not visual. We need to infer from typical scenarios. Since they ask for next step, options include: a) augment labor (oxytocin), b) position change, c) emergency C-section, d) abdominal US, e) uterine relaxation (tocolysis). Which two appropriate actions?\n\nWe need to guess what the tracing shows. Probably there is variable decelerations? At 39 weeks, 7 cm dilation, good progress, fetal heart perhaps showing late decelerations indicating uteroplacental insufficiency requiring emergency C-section. Or maybe shows early decelerations (normal) - then continue labor (maybe position change). Let's think. The qualities: they've already progressed from 2 cm to 7 cm in 3 hours, which is ~1.7 cm per hour, good. So if tracing normal, we continue.\n\nIf tracing shows variable decelerations moderate with deep but brief, we could do position change. If persistent severe variable decelerations not improved, then operative delivery.\n\nIf tracing shows Category II with prolonged decels etc, maybe augment labor with oxytocin.\n\nOption d abdominal US maybe for cord prolapse suspicion? Not indicated.\n\nGiven answer expects two choices.\n\nLet's hypothesize the tracing shows late decelerations, indicating uteroplacental insufficiency. The appropriate response is immediate C-section (c) and uterine relaxation with tocolysis? Actually late decels treat with maternal reposition, oxygen, IV fluids, stop oxytocin, maybe tocolysis rarely. But emergency C-section likely.\n\nIf tracing shows variable decelerations due to cord compression, first line is maternal position change (b). If not improve, then maybe amnioinfusion (not option). If persistent severe, C-section.\n\nGiven they ask for two correct, perhaps both b (position change) and c (emergency C-section). Or b and a (oxytocin). But oxytocin is used if protracted labor, not indicated here.\n\nLet's reason: The scenario highlights good cervical progress, head at +2, occiput anterior. So still early second stage? Actually 7 cm dilation, not second stage yet. So we are in active phase. If fetal heart tracing shows variable decelerations, first management is reposition. If not resolved and recurrent, move to cesarean.\n\nThus answer likely b and c.\n\nBut could also include a (augmented labor) if tracing shows late decels due to insufficient uterine activity (uteroplacental insufficiency?) Not typical.\n\nThus I'll answer b and c."

      "reasoning": "We need to answer a Japanese medical exam question: \"6 我が国の人工妊娠中絶で正しいのはどれか。\" Which statements are correct about induced abortion in Japan.\n\nOptions:\n\na 母子保健法に基づく。 (Based on the Maternal and Child Health Law.)\n\nb 胎児異常も中絶の適応である。 (Fetal abnormalities are also an indication for abortion.)\n\nc 年間 10 万件以上実施されている。 (More than 100,000 procedures per year.)\n\nd 本人の同意のみで実施可能である。 (Can be performed with only the woman's consent.)\n\ne 経口中絶薬はすべての医師が処方できる。 (Oral abortifacients can be prescribed by any physician.)\n\nWe need to pick the correct statement(s) - but likely only one is correct. Let's recall Japanese abortion law.\n\nIn Japan, induced abortion is permitted under the Maternal Health Protection Law? Actually the \"母子保健法\" is the Maternal and Child Health Act, which includes regulations for abortion? Wait there is the \"母体保護法\" (Maternal Protection Act). Actually historically, the \"母体保護法\" (Act on Securing the Health of Pregnant Women) governs abortion. The law permitting abortion is the \"母体保護法\" (Maternal Protection Law), enacted in 1948. The \"母子保健法\" (Maternal and Child Health Law) is separate; it includes perinatal health but not abortion. So a is likely false.\n\nb fetal abnormality: Under Japanese law, permitted indications are: (1) the pregnancy threatens the health of the mother, (2) the pregnancy results from rape, (3) the mother is under 16 years old? Actually there is also economic hardship? Wait, Japanese law: Abortion is permitted under the Maternal Health (Maternity Protection) Act for socioeconomic reasons? The law lists: 1) Threat to health of mother; 2) Pregnancy resulting from rape; 3) The pregnancy could cause the mother financial hardship? I think fetal abnormality is not a permitted indication under law. So b is false.\n\nc Annual number of abortions >100,000. How many abortions per year in Japan? I recall around 100,000-150,000 abortions per year historically. Data: In 2020, about 128,000 abortions (including medical and surgical) were performed. So >100k is true. So c may be correct.\n\nd Only the woman's consent is sufficient. Actually Japanese law requires consent of the pregnant woman and partner (husband) unless she is unmarried? Let's recall: Under law, both the pregnant woman and her spouse must consent, except if woman is unmarried, then only her consent is needed. Or maybe husband consent is required? I think the law requires the consent of the pregnant woman and the spouse/husband unless the pregnancy is result of rape, etc. So d is false.\n\ne Oral abortifacients prescription: In Japan, the oral abortifacient mifepristone (RU-486) is approved only for use by obstetricians/gynecologists at hospitals or designated clinics; not all physicians can prescribe. So e false.\n\nThus correct answer is c. So output.\n\n"

According to description, J2 means some disability but daily life almost independent and can go out alone using transportation etc.\n\nWe look at the case: She is 88, previously lived alone, now uses delivered meals (①), buys daily items at nearby shop (②), cannot go by bus to daughter's house, daughter visits weekly (③). She is resistant to support (④). She has some cognitive issues: repeats same story, incomprehensible (⑤). She walks fine.\n\nWhich items justify J2 classification? J2 requires ability to go out alone using transport or at least to neighbor. In the case, she cannot ride bus to daughter's house (so cannot go far), but can go to nearby shop herself. She uses transportation? Not explicitly, but she can go out on her own to nearby store. So ② indicates she can go out to shop (neighbor). Also ① indicates she uses delivered meals, maybe indicating decreased cooking ability, but still independent? For J2 they consider some disability but daily life almost independent. Using meal delivery shows some limitation in cooking but not total inability. However the key is ability to go out? J2 requires can go out independent, using transportation. She cannot take bus to daughter's house but can maybe go to nearby store. That's item ②. Also maybe ③ shows she cannot go to daughter's house, needing assistance, but still can go out locally? But ③ indicates she cannot travel by bus, so she can't go out independent for longer trips, only daughter visits. That suggests limited ability. But J2 still possible because she can go out locally. So which items were used as basis for judgment: likely ② (going out to shop) and ③ (cannot go out far, need assistance). But classification J2 says independent outside using transportation; but she cannot use bus. So maybe classification is based on ability to go out to nearby places (②) and ability to manage incontinence (self-changing pad) which is not listed. So maybe ① also indicates reduced cooking ability, indicating some disability but still independent. The judgment likely based on ① (meal delivery) and ② (shopping). But ① indicates she doesn't cook, but she may be able to eat delivered meals; that suggests some disability but not severe. However the classification J2 focuses on mobility and external activities. So I'd choose b and c? Let's think: J2 \"1. using transportation to go out. 2. can go out to nearby area.\" The case: She cannot use bus to daughter's house (③). But she does go to nearby shop (②). So we have evidence of ability to go out to neighbor => supports J2. There's no mention of using transportation, but maybe she can go by herself walking to shop—makes sense. So the root for J2 is item ② (shopping). And also maybe ⑤ (cognitive issues) indicates some disability but not enough to affect self-care, still independent => used? But J2 includes \"some disability\". The cognitive issues provide disability. So root could be ⑤. The question: \"下線部のうち、判断の根拠となった項目はどれか。\" Which underlined items? In statement they underlined a,b,c,d,e? Hard to know. But likely they underlined items that are relevant: ①,②,③,⑤ perhaps. Which two were used for J2? I think ② (goes out to shop) and ⑤ (cognitive issues) indicate some disability but still independent, matching J2. However ③ indicates she cannot go out far, which might push to A (semi-bedridden). But they still judged J2, maybe because she can go out to nearby, so ③ indicates limitation but not enough to downgrade. So maybe ③ is also considered. Need choose two. I'd choose b and c.\n\nThus answer: b,c."

However if bag-valve mask ventilation is insufficient and there is risk of aspiration and hypoxia, but still can attempt intubation. However they mention \"舌根沈下が強く下顎挙上しても SpO₂ は改善しない\" – severe airway obstruction. In such a scenario, the immediate airway management is to insert a supraglottic airway (like laryngeal mask airway) if intubation not possible quickly. But guidelines: When bag mask ventilation is inadequate, and you cannot maintain oxygenation, immediate airway insertion by endotracheal intubation is recommended; if intubation is not immediately possible, place a supraglottic airway or perform cricothyrotomy. Here they are asking \"この時点でまず行うのはどれか\" - what to do first. Usually in emergency: If bag-valve mask ventilation is ineffective, you should attempt a supraglottic airway (c) as a bridge before cricothyroidotomy. However many algorithms state: If cannot ventilate with mask, then use supraglottic airway; if that fails, cricothyrotomy.\n\nThus answer likely c.

But in this scenario, airway compromise is severe: tongue root depression (i.e., obstruction) not improved by jaw thrust, bag-valve not enough - suggests severe central respiratory drive depression (like barbiturates or opioids). Opioid overdose would cause respiratory depression but seizures are uncommon (unless combined). Not in answer list.\n\nPhenobarbital is a barbiturate, sedation, respiratory depression, hypotension, can cause seizures at withdrawal but overdose can cause paradoxical seizures? Actually barbiturate overdose can precipitate seizures, especially with short-acting ones (e.g., pentobarbital) but phenobarbital is long-acting; seizures are less common but can appear due to disinhibition.\n\nBut benzodiazepine overdose cause respiratory depression only mild, rarely severe, seizures not typical (they are anticonvulsant). So not BZ.\n\nThus likely tricyclic antidepressant? But TCA overdose would cause anticholinergic (dry mouth, dilated pupils, hyperthermia) and also seizures, hypotension, and ECG changes. Rapid immunoassay can detect TCA? Usually not part of standard tox screen, but some panels have \"tricyclic antidepressants\" detection.\n\nThe question: \"迅速簡易定性検査で 1 つの薬剤が検出された。服用したと考えられる薬剤はどれか。\" Means a rapid qualitative test (like urine drug screen) detected one drug. Which drug likely? Among options which is detectable by standard urine screening? Cocaine, amphetamine, tricyclic, phenobarbital, benzodiazepine. Standard immunoassays include cocaine metabolite (benzoylecgonine), amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines. TCA not usually on routine screens. So detection implies they found phenobarbital (a barbiturate). The clinical picture matches barbiturate overdose: respiratory depression refractory to bag‑valve because central drive suppressed; seizures before due to hyperexcitability? Actually initial seizures may be due to paradoxical reaction in some patients especially with short-acting barbiturates, but can occur.\n\nThus answer d.\n\nLet's output."

Not given but ECG likely low voltage.\n\nPatient older, with signs of heart failure with preserved EF, thickened walls, etc. The question 74: \"cause disease diagnosis important test\" (which test crucial to diagnose cause disease). They likely suspect cardiac amyloidosis (particularly light-chain AL amyloidosis vs transthyretin). Given older male, maybe transthyretin amyloid (senile systemic).

It supplies most of the small intestine up to the proximal two-thirds of transverse colon, i.e., duodenum, jejunum, ileum up to the proximal 2/3 of transverse colon. So jejunum is innervated by vagus. Anal sphincter (external anal sphincter) is skeletal muscle innervated by pudendal nerve (S2-4). Internal anal sphincter smooth muscle is autonomic via pelvic splanchnic nerves (parasympathetic S2-4) and sympathetic (hypogastric). Vagus does not reach the anal region.

      "reasoning": "We need to select the correct statement about telemedicine (online diagnosis) in Japan presumably. Let's recall Japanese regulations.\n\nAs of 2020, telemedicine rules: Telemedicine = remote medical care. The law allows prescription (e-prescription) can be done via telemedicine, but with restrictions: certain diseases require prior in-person. Generally, doctors can issue prescriptions via telemedicine if they have established doctor-patient relationship or certain systems. So statement a \"処方箋の交付はできない\" (prescription cannot be issued) is false because prescriptions can be issued.\n\nb \"プライバシーが保たれた空間で行う。\" Means telemedicine should be conducted in a private space maintaining privacy. That sounds correct: need to ensure privacy for both patient and doctor; recommended to have privacy.\n\nc \"感染症のリスクの軽減につながらない。\" That's false; telemedicine reduces infection risk.\n\nd \"第三者の立ち合いに医師の許可は必要ない。\" Means no need doctor's permission for a third party accompanying? In telemedicine, presence of a third party (like guardian) may be allowed; but if a third party is present, perhaps the patient's consent necessary? Not sure. The statement likely false.\n\ne \"文字、写真および録画動画のみのやり取りも認められる。\" Means only text, photo, recorded video communication is allowed. However, real-time video communication is typical; but not only asynchronous? In Japan, online medical consultation may be via video, audio, or text. But only text/photo/recorded video (i.e., not live) may not be sufficient for proper diagnosis; likely not permitted for initial diagnosis. So e is false.\n\nThus b is the correct statement.\n\nThus answer: b.\n\nOutput format: 【回答】b"
