But we don't have creatinine excretion. But approximate: protein excretion ≈ (protein/creatinine ratio) * 24h urine creatinine concentration (mg/dL?)

But typical formula: excretion rate (g/day) = (protein concentration mg/dL) / (creatinine concentration mg/dL) * (24h urine volume (mL)/100) (?) Let's compute ratio: 100/250=0.4 mg protein per mg creatinine. Multiply by 24h urine creatinine excretion (which unknown). But can approximate daily excretion = ratio * 24h urine creatinine excretion. But we can approximate 24h urine creatinine excretion using 24h Urine creatinine concentration * urine volume? if creatinine concentration mg/dL times volume mL /100? Actually creatinine excretion (mg/day) = urine creatinine concentration (mg/dL) * urine volume (mL) /100. Because 1 dL=100 mL. So excretion =250 mg/dL *1200 mL /100=250*12=3000 mg=3g of creatinine.\n\nThen protein excretion = ratio * creatinine excretion =0.4 *3000 mg=1200 mg=1.2 g/day. Express as g/gCr maybe? Actually the rubric asking for g/gCr? The answer is in g/gCr meaning grams protein per gram creatinine. Use protein excretion (g)/creatinine excretion (g). 1.2 g protein /3 g creatinine =0.4 g/gCr.
